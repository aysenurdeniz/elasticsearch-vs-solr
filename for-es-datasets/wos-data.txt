Computing Surveys focuses on integrating and adding understanding to the existing literature by publishing surveys and tutorials. This journal is published 9 times per year.

Surveys and Tutorials
Computing Surveys publishes comprehensive, readable tutorials and survey papers that give guided tours through the literature and explain topics to those who seek to learn the basics of areas outside their specialties. These carefully planned and presented introductions are also an excellent way for professionals to develop perspectives on, and identify trends in, complex technologies. Recent issues have covered image understanding, software reusability, and object and relational database topics.

Computing Surveys does not publish "new" research. This is left to the Transactions and other specialized publications of the ACM. Instead, Computing Surveys focuses on surveys and tutorials that integrate the existing literature and put its results in context.

The main difference between a survey and a tutorial is emphasis. A survey article assumes a general knowledge of the area; it emphasizes the classification of the existing literature, developing a perspective on the area, and evaluating trends. A tutorial assumes its audience is inexpert; it emphasizes the basic concepts of the field and provides concrete examples that embody these concepts.

Both surveys and tutorials must develop a framework or overall view of an area that integrates the existing literature. Frequently, such a framework exposes topics that need additional research; a good Computing Surveys article can fill such a void, but that is not its major purpose. Basically, a Computing Surveys article answers the questions, "What is currently known about this area, and what does it mean to researchers and practitioners?" It should supply the basic knowledge to enable new researchers to enter the area, current researchers to continue developments, and practitioners to apply the results.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"AI2 Semantic Scholar, Baidu, Clarivate / ISI: JCR, Clarivate / ISI: SCI, Clarivate / ISI: SCIE, CNKI, DBLP, DeepDyve, DTU (Technical University of Denmark), EBSCO: EDS, EBSCO: HOST, Elsevier: EI Compendex, Elsevier: SciMago, Elsevier: SCOPUS, EPO (European Patent Office), ExLibris  Google Scholar, IEEE: Xplore, IET Inspec, iGroup, Meta - Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Microsoft Academic Search, NII (National Institute of Informatics), OCUL Scholars Portal, Odysci, OhioLink, Pathgather, ProQuest: Summon Service, SIPX, SUWECO, WorldCat, WTI, Yewno, zbMATH"}

Major economic and technical challenges are expected to impede the continued scaling of semiconductor devices. This has resulted in the search for alternate mechanical, biological/biochemical, nanoscale electronic, asynchronous and quantum computing and sensor technologies. As the underlying nanotechnologies continue to evolve in the labs of chemists, physicists, and biologists, it has become imperative for computer scientists and engineers to translate the potential of the basic building blocks (analogous to the transistor) emerging from these labs into information systems. Their design will face multiple challenges ranging from the inherent (un)reliability due to the self-assembly nature of the fabrication processes for nanotechnologies, from the complexity due to the sheer volume of nanodevices that will have to be integrated for complex functionality, and from the need to integrate these new nanotechnologies with silicon devices in the same system.

JETC provides comprehensive coverage of innovative work in the specification, design analysis, simulation, verification, testing, and evaluation of computing systems constructed out of emerging technologies and advanced semiconductors. Topics include, but are not limited to:

Logic Primitive Design and Synthesis
how to design computational logic primitives from the new nanotechnologies and design tools supporting their effective design and verification

System-Level Specification, Design and Synthesis

TALLIP is also open to articles that provide literature and/or technology reviews in one of the above-mentioned areas. However, in order to be considered for publication, such an article must demonstrate that it provides information that is substantially different from what is available in the literature. The author(s) of review articles must submit a cover letter that clearly states why they believe their contribution adds useful material not covered elsewhere. Also, a review article should not just be a summarization of previous work: it must also be a work of exegesis. That is, the author(s) must show how the different strands of work relate to each other. They should also offer a view of where the field under review is going. A survey or review article submitted to TALLIP will go through the usual review process only if the editors feel the submission adheres to the above guidelines.

Finally, starting with issue 12(4), a new editorial column entitled TALLIP Perspectives (formerly TALIP Perspectives) has been launched. The editorial column is open anyone who wants to contribute an editorial on topics relevant to Asian language and speech processing. Contributors should contact the Editor directly.

TAAS aims at disseminating high quality scientific and technological research results in the area of autonomous and adaptive systems, as defined in the About section. It is published on a quarterly basis. Types of Articles
TAAS aims to publish papers that provably advance the state of the art, or that provide new insights and knowledge into specific issues related to autonomous and adaptive systems.

Authors submitting papers to this journal should support their arguments via performance evaluations, logical proofs, and statistical data or usability tests - depending on what applies to the specific case. Also, authors must demonstrate novelty with respect to the state of the art.

Survey papers are welcome, provided that they are of high quality, and may serve the purpose of informing researchers, professionals, and students about areas within the remit of this journal.

Purely speculative papers, papers that claim research results without supporting them with appropriate validation arguments, or survey papers that reduce to a list of known techniques without apparent rationale are not of interest to this journal.

Originality
Articles submitted to TAAS must be original, and must not have been published (or been/being submitted for evaluation) elsewhere. Extended versions of papers from conference and workshop proceedings may be acceptable, provided that the TAAS version notably extends prior publications with new results and discussion. Authors are required to clearly state where this is the case when they submit their paper to TAAS.

Style and Length
Articles must be in English. They should have an introductory part that is comprehensible by a non-expert, and should reference up-to-date related literature. TAAS enforces a limit on the length of papers to 10000 words (20 printed pages). Papers exceeding 10000 words will have to either be shortened, or have to move some of the material to an appendix that will only be published online.

Unethical articles
TAAS reserves the right to impose the revision of, or if necessary to refuse, a paper - despite its scientific and technical quality - whenever its content is explicitly unethical or if it supports racism, sexual or religious discrimination, illegal activities or terrorism; similarly an article may be refused if the editors deem that it might harm the political or religious sensitivity of interested readers in any manner.                      ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems (TAAS) is a venue for high-quality research contributions addressing foundational, engineering, and technological aspects supporting the development and management of autonomous adaptive systems. TAAS focuses on system design, system software architectures, and enabling technologies. It particularly welcomes results supported by experimental validation.

The journal welcomes regular and survey papers related to the topics below:

Foundations to system autonomy and self-adaptation.
Theories, methods, and tools to reason about autonomous and self-adaptive behavior of software systems.
Practical cases, experience and analysis of engineering/developing autonomous and adaptive systems.
Software system architectures supporting autonomous behavior and/or self-adaptation.
Programming languages, middleware, operating systems, and network solutions for autonomous and adaptive systems.

TiiS publishes articles on research concerning the design, realization, or evaluation of interactive systems that incorporate certain form of machine intelligence. Such interactive intelligent systems are associated with a set of defining characteristics. In addition, TiiS articles come from a wide range of research areas and communities. An article can take any of several complementary views of interactive intelligent systems as described below, with a focus on (a) the intelligent technology, (b) the interaction of users with the system, or (c) both aspects at the same time. This journal is published on a quarterly basis. 

Defining Characteristics
The first defining characteristic of interactive intelligent systems is that they include some form of intelligence  in the sense used in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), though in some cases the technology in question is no longer primarily or strongly associated with the AI field.

The second defining characteristic, interactivity, normally means that what the system does is perceived by  and influenced by  its users. Where no user input to a system is possible, the system can still be considered interactive if it is intended to support some sort of action on the part of the users. For example, a system that generates performances of virtual characters for the entertainment of passive viewers would not be considered interactive. But if the characters performances are intended to support some sort of decision-making or action by users, the system can be viewed as interactive, because it raises many of the same general issues that are raised by systems that are interactive in a narrower sense.

Complementary Views
The graphic below visualizes three complementary views in research on interactive intelligent systems, all of which will be found in TiiS published articles:

[complementary views]

Focus on Intelligent Technology
At one end of the spectrum lies research that focuses primarily on understanding or improving intelligent technology for interactive systems. It often takes as its point of departure some form of interaction with intelligent systems that has already been realized successfully and aims to enhance it by improving the technology (e.g., by providing faster learning, more accurate recognition, or more reliable prediction).

Focus on Users' Interaction With Intelligent Systems
At the other end of the spectrum, we find research that takes as a starting point some existing intelligent technology and aims to find better ways of interacting with systems that incorporate such technology (e.g., by exploring new interface designs, interaction styles, or usage contexts).

Binocular View
In the middle of the spectrum, we have research that aims to advance understanding of both intelligent technology and users interaction with it  for example, by looking for better combinations of intelligent technology and interaction (e.g., a novel algorithm accompanied by a new interaction design that enables people to use it effectively).

Ensuring Relevance to the Journal
Articles anywhere on this continuum can make valuable contributions, and all of them are welcome in TiiS. But there is an important requirement: A manuscript that focuses almost exclusively either on intelligent technology or on interaction must also include at least a brief discussion of the other side of the picture, so as to make clear the relevance of the articles contributions to the general issues addressed by TiiS. (See the subsection Explaining Relevance in the Authors Introduction for hints about how to formulate such a brief discussion.)

Research on Interactive Intelligent Systems
Although interactive intelligent systems can take many specific forms, there are some general research questions that arise whenever human intelligence comes into contact with machine intelligence, such as the following:

In what ways can artificial and human intelligence work together effectively?
For example, where does machine intelligence offer the greatest added value? How can effective mixed-initiative interaction be achieved?

What challenges to usability and acceptability can the incorporation of intelligence in an interactive system raise, and what strategies are effective in meeting these challenges?
For example, how can it be ensured that users have adequate forms and levels of control over an autonomously acting systems behavior and that responsibility is assigned appropriately?

What types of methodology for research, design, and evaluation are especially suitable for interactive intelligent systems  and how can such methodologies be improved?

Such subjects include, but are not limited to: scalable and effective algorithms for data mining and big data analysis, mining brain networks, mining data streams, mining multi-media data, mining high-dimensional data, mining text, Web, and semi-structured data, mining spatial and temporal data, data mining for community generation, social network analysis, and graph structured data, security and privacy issues in data mining, visual, interactive and online data mining, pre-processing and post-processing for data mining, robust and scalable statistical methods, data mining languages, foundations of data mining, KDD framework and process, and novel applications and infrastructures exploiting data mining technology including massively parallel processing and cloud computing platforms. This journal is published six times a year.

TKDD encourages papers that explore the above subjects in the context of large distributed networks of computers, parallel or multiprocessing computers, or new data devices. TKDD also encourages papers that describe emerging data mining applications that cannot be satisfied by the current data mining technology.
TKDD welcomes papers that both lay theoretical foundations for data mining, big data and those that provide new insights into the design and implementation of large-scale data mining systems and tools, data mining interface tools, and data mining tools that integrate with the overall information processing infrastructure.

TKDD also accepts papers that describe user and data mining developer and administration experiences and issues in large-scale real-world data mining applications.  The emphasis on integration of theory and practice is an attempt to encourage authors of theory papers to consider applicability and/or implementability of the theoretical results, while encouraging authors of systems papers to reflect on the theoretical results that may have been used in building the systems and/or to offer suggestions on issues that may require theoretical treatment.

TKDD also solicits focused surveys on topics relevant to the publication. These should be deep and will sometimes be quite narrow, but should make a contribution to our understanding of an important area or subarea of databases.  More general surveys that are intended for a broad-based Computer Science audience or surveys that may influence other areas of computing research should continue to go to ACM Computing Surveys. TKDD surveys should be educational to the database audience by presenting a relatively well-established body of database research.

For additional information on the types of papers TKDD will accept, see Editorial Guidelines.

The international Editorial Board is composed of recognized experts in the various subareas of this field, all with a commitment to maintain TKDD as the premier publication in this active field. The Editorial Board maintains contact with ACM's Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (SIGKDD), as well as with other societies, to encourage submission of advanced and original papers. When appropriate, concise results may be submitted as technical notes; technical comments on earlier publications are welcome as well.

This journal is published on a quarterly basis.

In addition, TOMS publishes machine-readable computer software which is incorporated into the Collected Algorithms of the ACM; such software may be written in any programming language that is in widespread use, but the author must be able to make the case as to why the language chosen was the most appropriate given the goals of wide usability and applicability of research published in TOMS.

In both research papers and software, TOMS seeks contributions of lasting value in which technical quality, relevance to significant computations, interest, and novelty are all high, and where presentation is effective.

This scope of TOMS involves a number of dimensions, each of which overlap TOMS to some degree.

Methodology
Design, development and implementation of algorithms
Design of user and system interfaces
Analysis, testing and evaluation of algorithms and computer programs
Documentation, dissemination, and maintenance of computer programs

Differential and integral equations
Optimization
Computational geometry
Discrete and symbolic mathematical algorithms
Pattern recognition
Sorting, searching, and classifying

None of these topics completely overlaps the scope of TOMS, however. To be considered for TOMS, manuscripts must address such topics in the context of the production, evaluation and use of well-engineered mathematical software which supports significant computer applications. Purely theoretical papers from traditional areas (e.g., numerical analysis or software engineering) that are not presented in the context of mathematical software are rarely acceptable. At the other extreme, papers that are essentially user manuals or tutorials for a computer program are also normally unacceptable as also are papers which entirely application/subject specific.

In general, TOMS manuscripts are expected to contain (a) motivation for the problem considered, (b) an indication of the relationship of the work to the current state-of-the-art, (c) a technical analysis of the proposed solution, (d) evidence of effectiveness and practicality, and (e) evidence of superiority compared to the best alternative approaches.

In many cases, effectiveness can be demonstrated through careful analysis. However, data obtained from well designed experiments may be needed to justify claims of practical superiority. For papers whose principal contribution is the implementation of novel computational methods, an extensive experimental evaluation of computer implementations, including comparisons with the best available software for the problem, is typically required. For a paper whose principal contribution is in software or interface design, evidence of its superiority may include empirical data demonstrating an improvement in readability, usability or robustness. Examples could include simplification and reduction of function parameters, reduction of code size, capability of handling more general situations, improved error handling, and the use of objects or constructs that are naturally suited for the application area. Such assertions should be supported by quantitative evidence whenever possible.

Survey papers are acceptable, provided they have a fairly narrow focus, summarize and organize recent research in a way that is itself novel, and contribute to the advancement of research in the field.

It publishes reviews (including comprehensive assessments on complete actuator products), regular research papers and short notes.

Scope
Actuators covers studies related to all types of actuators and actuation technologies, actuator control systems, and their applications in the following areas:

Land Transport
This involves the primary function of transforming on-board energy into commands to wheels for land transport (motorcycles, cars, buses, trucks, trains, etc.). These wheel drives must be very durable (20,000 hours), very efficient (~85%), and independent to respond to command and to meet adverse operating conditions.

Aircraft
The dominant requirements are fault tolerance (no single point failures), torque/force density, and efficiency. Generally, distributed control with a minimum weight, volume, etc. and standardized interfaces for rapid repair and refreshment are essential.

Medical Instruments
Here, the question is reliability and miniaturization, especially in surgery or other invasive operations. It is useful also to have a high efficiency (low operating temperature and low noise), especially in rehabilitation systems.

Robotics
This has now become a very diverse field, from industrial manipulators to mobile platforms used to move packages in internet-based distribution centers. Durability and cost are the major measures of success.

Manufacturing
This involves two distinct application ranges. The first is the simple handling and preparation of product components for assembly (polishing, trimming, forming, painting, etc.). The other end of the spectrum involves high accuracy even under machining force disturbances. The first involves cost (system assembly, repair, and up-dates using standardized modules performed by a well-trained high school-level technician). The other end involves high value-added precision operations (machining, drilling, cutting, etc.), rejecting force disturbances using high-end sensor data and multi-criteria-based operating system software.

Materials
This involves a very wide range of choices. For transport, low weight/high stiffness could be an issue. In the medical field, the material must be lucent relative to measurement signals (MRI, x-ray) during surgery. Some material applications may require a high formability, high resistance to chemicals, low contact friction, etc.

Power/Torque Density
Increasingly, many high-level applications require a high output power or torque relative to the weight and volume. A prime mover may offer 1 ft-lb/lb. up to 6 ft-lb/lb. of torque. The prime mover may operate at a full range of speeds (say, from 1 to 50 k RPM) to offer a very wide range of power densities.  All of this is affected by the basic actuator reality, that it must control positive/negative operations through cross overs in the minimum time in order to best manage the complex output functions under command.

Precision
A lot of applications are dominated by a need for precision response (position, velocity, acceleration, torque, etc.) to command. This is especially true of many medical, military, and manufacturing domains. Precision response depends first on having high-end sensors to measure the response quality to command, which informs the decision making software to respond to disturbances with the minimum latency.  Unfortunately, most actuators are highly nonlinear, making this topic of special value to all future high-end actuator applications.

Miniaturization
Computer electronics based on the miniaturized chip are essential for advanced decision-making systems. The same is the case for actuators in the medical field, precision handling in small assemblies, product inspection, etc. Here, the piezo element likely becomes the principal prime mover fully integrated into a position/force/torque transformer to provide a wide range of very small physical operations under command.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"CNKI, DOAJ, EBSCO, Elsevier, Scopus, Gale, Inspec, J-Gate, OpenAIRE, PATENTSCOPE, ProQuest, Web of Science, SCIE, Current Contents - Engineering, Computing & Technology, Journal Ranking Lists, Danish Bibliometric Research Indicator (BFI), Essential Science Indicators, Journal Citation Reports (JCR), Norwegian Register for Scientific Journals, Series and Publishers, SCImago, Journal Directories, BibCnrs, Electronic Journals Library (EZB), Research4Life, AGORA, ARDI, Sherpa Romeo, Digital Preservation, CLOCKSS, Swiss National Library (Helveticat), Content Aggregators, Google Scholar, Scilit, WorldCat (OCLC)"}

Explicit knowledge representation formalisms and new reasoning techniques are no longer the sole territory of computer science. For knowledge-intensive tasks in engineering, a new philosophy and body of knowledge called Engineering Informatics is emerging.

Advanced Engineering Informatics solicits research papers with particular emphases both on 'knowledge' and 'engineering applications'. As an international Journal, original papers typically:

 Report progress in the engineering discipline of applying methods of engineering informatics.
 Have engineering relevance and help provide the scientific base to make engineering decision-making more reliable, spontaneous and creative.
 Contain novel research that demonstrates the science of supporting knowledge-intensive engineering tasks.
 Validate the generality, power and scalability of new methods through vigorous evaluation, preferably both qualitatively and quantitatively.

In addition, the Journal welcomes high quality review articles that summarise, compare, and evaluate methodologies and representations that are proposed for the field of engineering informatics. Similarly, summaries and comparisons of full-scale applications are welcomed, particularly those where scientific shortcomings have hindered success. Typically, such papers have expanded literature reviews and discussion of findings that reflect mastery of the current body of knowledge and propose novel additions to contemporary research.

Papers missing explicit representation and use of knowledge, such as those describing soft computing techniques, mathematical optimization methods, pattern recognition techniques, and numerical computation methods, do not normally qualify for publication in the Journal. Papers must illustrate contributions using examples of automating and supporting knowledge intensive tasks in artifacts-centered engineering fields such as mechanical, manufacturing, architecture, civil, electrical, transportation, environmental, and chemical engineering. Papers that report application of an established method to a new engineering subdomain will qualify only if they convincingly demonstrate noteworthy new power, generality or scalability in comparison with previously reported validation results.

The increasing complexity and scope of computer applications makes the design of efficient algorithms essential.

Algorithmica is an international journal which publishes original papers on algorithms that are either (i) theoretical papers addressing problems arising in practical areas or (ii) experimental papers that have general appeal because of their practical importance or techniques. Papers are expected to make significant contributions, judged in terms of theoretical analysis, simulations, or algorithm behavior on data from applications. The areas listed below are representative areas; papers in other areas are certainly welcome.
The fields of interest include algorithms in applied areas such as: VLSI, distributed computing, parallel processing, automated design, robotics, graphics, data base design, software tools, as well as algorithms in fundamental areas such as sorting, searching, data structures, computational geometry, and linear programming. It is expected that the areas covered by this journal will change as new technologies, methodologies and applications develop.

In addition to these regular papers, the journal features two special sections: Application Experience and Problems.

The objective of the Application Experience section is to publish findings obtained from applications of theoretical results to practical situations. Findings include, but are not limited to, difficulties encountered in the course of the implementation or testing of algorithms (e.g., handling of degenerate cases which are often not addressed in detail but which actually occur in practice), nontrivial deviations of actual running times of the implemented algorithms from the asymptotic analytical studies, comparisons of actual performance of various algorithms proposed, and discussions of applicability of theoretical studies in practice. All submissions wil l be subject to the reviewing process and copies of source codes should be made available upon request by the Editor for reviewing purposes.

The Problems section publishes short papers presenting problems on selected topics of computer science. Special emphasis will be given to papers surveying open problems in a specific area of interest. Contributions will begin with a title and an introductory statement identifying a theme of research, followed by a list of related problems which to the author's knowledge are as yet unsolved. Authors are encouraged to annotate the text with comments, background material and appropriate references. All submissions will be subject to the reviewing process.

In developing this language, mathematicians prove results and design methods that often have applications in different scientific areas. In using this language, scientists consider algebra as an indispensable tool to create methods and techniques that facilitate their research.

Applicable Algebra in Engineering, Communication and Computing will publish mathematically rigorous, original research papers reporting on algebraic results, methods and techniques relevant to all domains concerned with computers, intelligent systems and communications. Its scope includes, but is not limited to, finite fields, algebraic curves, curves and geometry, number theory, error correcting codes, cryptography, arithmetics, algorithms, complexity, computer algebra, symbolic computation, term rewriting systems, theorem proving, vision, robotics. 

The Journal was founded by Thomas Beth and Jacques Calmet as a spin-off of  the AAECC conference oriented to algebraic techniques in coding theory started by Alain Poli in 1983; the aim was interdisciplinarity based upon the notion of applicable algebra.

Reformulating and adapting Thomas Beths introduction to the AAECC-4 Conference, the general aims of the A.A.E.C.C. Journal can be expressed in the form of the following pentagon:

AA Applicable Algebra: Algebraic foundations and techniques applicable to any scientific area, mainly mathematics, statistics, computer science, electrical and communications  engineering AE Algebraic Engineering: Algebraic algorithms, their improvements, complexity analysis EC Error-correcting Codes: Algebraic structure, analysis, optimality, engineering and communication applications CC Combinatorics and Cryptography: Combinatorial techniques leading to effective applications, classical mathematics applied to cryptography and cryptographic systems CA Computer Algebra: Symbolic and algebraic computation, solving polynomial systems, mathematical software We therefore intend to attract papers which have a solid mathematical background (in algebra or related topics such as combinatorics and number theory) and have some potential applications.

Purely theoretical papers will not primarily be sought, but papers dealing with problems in such domains as commutative or non-commutative algebra, group theory, field theory, or real algebraic geometry, which are of potential interest for applications in the above mentioned fields are relevant for this journal.

On the practical side, technology and know-how transfer papers from engineering and computer science are out of the scope of the journal unless they stimulate or illustrate research in applicable algebra.

To exploit the immense opportunities of widespread networks effectively, designers of modern information systems need to combine the precision of formal semantics with the needs of cognitive transparency, as they incorporate increasingly sophisticated and heterogeneous information content. The recent explosion of interest on ontologies is an important component of this trend. Researchers in disciplines such as knowledge engineering, information systems modeling, artificial intelligence, formal and computational linguistics, information retrieval, library science, and knowledge management have come to realize that a solid foundation for their research calls for serious work in ontology, understood as a general theory of the types of entities and relations that make up their respective domains of inquiry. In all these areas, attention has started to focus squarely on the content of information, rather than on just the formats and languages used to represent that content.

Applied Ontology focuses on information content in its broadest sense. As the subtitle makes clear, two broad kinds of content-based research activities are envisioned: ontological analysis and conceptual modeling. The former includes any attempt to investigate the nature and structure of a domain of interest using rigorous philosophical or logical tools; the latter concerns the cognitive and linguistic structures we use to model the world, as well as the various analysis tools and methodologies we adopt for producing useful computational models, such as information systems schemes or knowledge structures. Applied Ontology is the first journal with explicit and exclusive focus on ontological analysis and conceptual modeling under an interdisciplinary view. It aims to establish a unique niche in the realm of scientific journals by carefully avoiding unnecessary duplication with discipline-oriented journals. For this reason, authors will be encouraged to use language that will be intelligible also to those outside their specific sector of expertise, and the review process will be tailored to this end. For example, authors of theoretical contributions will be encouraged to show the relevance of their theory for applications, while authors of more technological papers will be encouraged to show the relevance of a well-founded theoretical perspective. Moreover, the journal will publish papers focusing on representation languages or algorithms only where these address relevant content issues, whether at the level of practical application or of theoretical understanding. Similarly, it will publish descriptions of tools or implemented systems only where a contribution to the practice of ontological analysis and conceptual modeling is clearly established.

Applied Ontology aims at being a major publication forum for theoretical and applied research in a variety of topics, tentatively grouped together in research areas, examples of which are indicated in the list below.

Foundational issues  Philosophical foundations of ontology  Basic ontological categories and relations  Ontology, epistemology, and semiotics
Specialized ontologies  Ontology of time, events and processes  Ontology of space and geography  Ontology of physics and physical objects  Ontology of biomedicine  Ontology of mental entities  Ontology of agents and actions  Ontology of organizations and social reality  Ontology of the information society  Ontology of business and e-commerce  Ontology of law  Ontology of history, culture and evolution
Ontology development and ontology-driven conceptual modeling  Methodologies for ontology development  Impact of ontological analysis on current modeling practices  Best-practice examples and case studies
Ontology management  Tools for ontology development, analysis and comparison  Comparison and evaluation of ontologies  Ontology management, maintenance, versioning  Methodologies for ontology merging, alignment, and integration  Semantic Web
Ontology and language  Ontology and natural-language semantics  Ontology and lexical resources  Ontology and terminology  Ontology learning techniques and their evaluation  Role of ontology in natural-language systems
Ontology, cognition, perception  Conceptual schemas, perceptual invariances and ontological categorization  Psychological experiments evaluating the cognitive adequacy of ontological categories
Ontology and content standards  Library science  Knowledge organization  Museums and cultural repositories  Multimedia content  Product descriptions  Process and service descriptions  Biomedical and other scientific terminologies

We are introducing a new concept in scientific and technical publications The Translational Case Report in Bioengineering. It is a descriptive explanatory analysis of a transformative or translational event. Understanding that the goal of bioengineering scholarship is to advance towards a transformative or clinical solution to an identified transformative/clinical need, the translational case report is used to explore causation in order to find underlying principles that may guide other similar transformative/translational undertakings.
Manuscripts regarding research proposals and research ideas will be particularly welcomed.
Electronic files and software regarding the full details of the calculation and experimental procedure, if unable to be published in a normal way, can be deposited as supplementary material.
We also accept manuscripts communicating to a broader audience with regard to research projects financed with public funds.

The Chemical Engineering Journal is an international research journal and invites contributions of original and novel fundamental research. The journal aims to provide an international forum for the presentation of original fundamental research, interpretative reviews and discussion of new developments in chemical engineering. Papers which describe novel theory and its application to practice are welcome, as are those which illustrate the transfer of techniques from other disciplines. Reports of carefully executed experimental work, which is soundly interpreted are also welcome. The overall focus is on original and rigorous research results that have generic significance.

Within the Chemical Engineering Journal, the Catalysis section presents Experimental and Theoretical studies in the fields of heterogeneous catalysis, molecular catalysis, and biocatalysis with industrial impact on chemicals, energy, materials, foods, healthcare, and environmental protection

Within the Chemical Engineering Journal, the Environmental Chemical Engineering section presents papers dealing with emerging topics in environmental chemical and process engineering, including pollution control, separation processes, advanced oxidation processes, adsorption of contaminants, resources recovery, waste-to-energy, environmental nanotechnology and bioprocesses, CO2 capture and utilization, and micro(nano) plastic detection and remediation.

Within the Chemical Engineering Journal, the Chemical Reaction Engineering section presents papers on a wide range of topics including reaction kinetics, simulation and optimization of different types of reactors, unsteady-state reactors, multiphase reactors, and process intensification including fundamental investigations of the processes of heat, mass and momentum transfer that take place along with chemical reactions. Innovative research works addressing critical areas of reactor engineering (e.g. novel reactor designs and materials, reactor safety and environmental issues), and emerging reactor technologies (e.g. membrane reactors, chromatographic reactors, unconventional fluidized bed reactors, electrochemical reactors, micro-reactors, photoreactors, fuel cells, enzymatic reactors, etc.) are particularly welcome. Submissions based entirely on e.g., numerical simulations with commercial CFD codes without novel experimental validation; novel sensing devices without a component of reaction engineering; theoretical mathematics; combustion in the context of energy conversion; or straightforward bioreactor applications (bacteria or animal cells) are highly discouraged, as these will find better fit in other existent journals.

Within the Chemical Engineering Journal, the Green and Sustainable Science and Engineering section presents papers focusing on innovative scientific and engineering solutions for sustainable future of human beings and nature. Topics in this section include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) Emerging materials and processes for green conversion of resources (including oil, gas, coal, biomass, plastics, and synthesis gas); 2) Green processes and system integration for renewable and clean energy production (including biofuels and H2), advanced treatment of air/water/solids, resource recovery (including nutrients, heavy metals, rare earth elements, and energy), energy-food-water nexus, and minimization of environmental pollution and hazardous materials (including environmental and economic impact assessment); and 3) Innovative separation, purification, and storage technologies for renewable and clean energy, greenhouse gases (e.g., CO2 and CH4), and intermediates/by-products.

The Novel Materials for Energy and Advanced Applications section of Chemical Engineering Journal considers papers describing the development of new functional materials and/or materials processing strategies with demonstrated practical applications. Theoretical calculations can be included, but all papers considered must have an experimental component. Any paper with a demonstrated application will be considered, including:

Discovery science (also known as discovery-based science) is a scientific methodology which emphasizes analysis of large volumes of experimental data or text data with the goal of finding new patterns or correlations, leading to hypothesis formation and other scientific methodologies. Tools of interest include: Data Mining: looking for associations or relationships in operational or transactional data; Text Mining and Information Extraction: looking for concepts and their associations or relationships in natural language text; Structured, semi-structured and unstructured text mining; Text Summarization: extracting terms and phrases from large text document collections that summarize their content; Web mining: Web structure, content and usage mining; and, Ontology Learning from Text and Data bases.

Web intelligence and semantic web.  Web intelligence is concerned with the application of AI to the next generation of web systems, services and resources. These include better search/retrieval algorithms, client side systems (e.g. more effective agents) and server side systems (e.g. effective ways to present material on web pages and throughout web sites, including adaptive websites and personalized interfaces).
The semantic web is an extension to the World Wide Web, in which web content is expressed in a form that is accessible to programs (software agents), following the vision of the web as universal medium for data, information and knowledge exchange.

Agents and multiagent systems.  Agents as a computational abstraction have replaced 'objects' in software and have provided the necessary ingredients to move to societies of interacting intelligent entities, based on concepts like agent societies, market economies, e-commerce models and game theory. Such abstractions are dispersed throughout the scientific world, depending largely on applications. Multiagent systems (MAS) are systems in which many autonomous intelligent agents interact with each other. Agents can be either cooperative, pursuing a common goal, or selfish, going after their own interests. Architectures, interaction protocols and languages must be developed for multiagent systems. Topics of interest include: Autonomy-oriented computing; Agent systems methodology and language; Agent-based simulation and modeling; Agent-based applications; Agent-based negotiation and autonomous auction; Advanced Software Engineering supports for Multiagent systems; Trust in Agent Society; and Distributed problem solving.

Machine learning in knowledge-based systems.  Knowledge-based systems aim to make expertise available for decision making, and information sharing, when and where needed. The next generation of such systems needs to tap into large domain-specific knowledge, which combine machine learning and structured background knowledge representation, such as ontology, and causal representations and constraint reasoning. Information sharing is concerned with creating collaborative knowledge environments for sharing and disseminating information. Learning is based on real-world data. Key challenges involve the decomposition of practical problems into multiple learnable components, the interaction between the components, and the application of suitable learning algorithms, often in the absence of adequate amounts of labeled training data. Topics of interest include the application of machine learning methods to new practical problems introducing novel algorithms, system frameworks of learnable components or evaluation techniques.

Key application areas of AI. We aim to make the journal the focus of key application areas, where AI is making a significant impact, but lack a coherent publication venue. These include: Business Intelligence, i.e. data mining to support business decision makers; Social Network mining, e.g. modelling aggregate properties and dynamics of social networks, classifying vertices and edges of social networks, identifying clusters of users; Critical Infrastructure Protection, e.g. intrusion/anomaly detection & response, learning knowledge bases of system administration, log file mining); Entertainment and Game Development, i.e. building game engines using AI techniques; Software Engineering, including program understanding, software repositories and reverse engineering; Business, Finance, Commerce and Economics: learning aggregate behaviours (e.g. stock market trends) or modeling individual and group demographics (e.g. web mining); and Knowledge-based and Personalized User Interfaces, to make interaction clearer to the user and more efficient, with better support for the users' goals, and efficient presentation of complex information.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"ABI/INFORM Collection (ProQuest), Academic Search (EBSCO Publishing), Academic Search Alumni Edition (EBSCO Publishing), Academic Search Premier (EBSCO Publishing), Advanced Technologies & Aerospace Database (ProQuest), American Business Law Journal (Academy of Legal Studies in Business), Business Premium Collection (ProQuest), CatchWord (Publishing Technology), COMPENDEX (Elsevier), CompuMath Citation Index (Clarivate Analytics), Computer Abstracts (Emerald), Computer Science Index (EBSCO Publishing), Current Contents: Engineering, Computing & Technology (Clarivate Analytics), Current Index to Statistics (ASA/IMS), EBSCO Online (EBSCO Publishing), InfoTrac (GALE Cengage), Journal Citation Reports/Science Edition (Clarivate Analytics), Mathematical Reviews/MathSciNet/Current Mathematical Publications (AMS), Proquest Business Collection (ProQuest), ProQuest Central (ProQuest), ProQuest Central K-120, PsycINFO/Psychological Abstracts (APA), Science Citation Index Expanded (Clarivate Analytics), SciTech Premium Collection (ProQuest), SCOPUS (Elsevier), Technology Collection (ProQuest), The DBLP Computer Science Bibliography (University of Trier)"}

These include, among others, transportation, economics, investment strategy, inventory control, logistics, safety, reliability, urban planning, and ecology. Computers & Operations Research (COR) provides an international forum for the application of computers and operations research techniques to problems in these and related fields.

The common element in all the scientific areas that this Journal addresses is the need for some optimization methodology for determining viable solutions to problems, using computers and the techniques of operations research. However, it is not only the methodology which is of interest: the applications are of equal importance. The two are mutually supportive, since understanding the application helps one greatly to comprehend the optimization methods used, and vice versa.

This Journal will therefore concern itself with these scientific fields of application, and will be accordingly broad in scope of subject matter. The form, content and language of the articles will take cognizance of this breadth of applications and of the consequent fact that many readers may not be expert in the scientific field to which the computer and operations research techniques are applied by the author.

All full-length research papers must contain original research results, and demonstrate constructive algorithmic complexity and extensive numerical experiments. Numerical illustrations (examples) are not sufficient: the numerical experiments must have a scientific value of their own, particularly with comparisons to other approaches. In addition, the research performed should represent novel and significant work relative to the relevant literature. The use of real-world data is also valued.

(Meta)heuristics (other than well-established algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms or ant colony optimization) must be described in metaphor-free language. This is a way to ensure that they are immediately comparable to existing algorithms. Moreover, this facilitates highlighting the algorithmic contributions to the literature.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"Computer Abstracts Computer Contents, ACM Guide to Computing Literature, Science Citation Index, Current Contents, Current Contents - Engineering, Computing & Technology, Artificial Intelligence Abstracts, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, Computer Reviews, Engineering Index, INSPEC, Information Science Abstracts, Legal Contents, Management Contents, Mathematical Reviews, Pascal Francis, Current Contents, SSSA/CISA/ECA/ISMEC, IAOR, ABI/Inform, CompuScience, Zentralblatt MATH"}

The range of appropriate contributions is wide, and includes papers on establishing appropriate mathematical models and their numerical solution in all areas of mechanics. The journal also includes articles that present a substantial review of a field in the topics of the journal.

With the modern use of computers and numerical methods to model and solve problems, the traditional boundaries between the fields of solid/structural mechanics and fluid mechanics hardly exist any longer, and multiphysics problems are solved that involve all aspects of mechanics. The word 'structures' must therefore now be interpreted in a broad sense including solids, fluids and multiphysics.

Computers & Structures publishes papers in these fields that either present novel and quite general techniques, or offer substantial new insights into important methods. If a paper presents novel techniques, some comparison with known advanced methods is necessary. If a paper is to provide substantial new insights into advanced methods, then this can be achieved by strong numerical experiments, some mathematical analysis, and/or comparisons with well-designed physical test data. In either case, the paper must contribute to advancing the state of the art.

The focus of Computers & Structures is on having an impact on the practice of simulations in mechanics as found in many industries and research endeavours, including the fields of engineering, such as civil and environmental, mechanical, biomechanical, automotive, aeronautical, and ocean engineering, and including the various fields of the sciences.

In these areas, papers are sought on the automatic solution of mathematical models of 'structures' in the broadest sense, possibly including phenomena of multiphysics, multiscale, and uncertainties.

The development of advanced numerical techniques and constitutive modeling, in conjunction with rapid developments in computer hardware, enables problems to be tackled that were unthinkable even a few years ago. Computers and Geotechnics provides an up-to-date reference for engineers and researchers engaged in computer aided analysis and research in geotechnical engineering. The journal is intended for an expeditious dissemination of advanced computer applications across a broad range of geotechnical topics. Contributions on advances in numerical algorithms, computer implementation of new constitutive models and probabilistic methods are especially encouraged. The application of newly proposed numerical methods and techniques to complex geotechnical engineering problems or to well-documented case studies are of interest. However, submissions that predominantly report results from proprietary codes, describe computer modelling of laboratory tests, field monitoring, or case histories, or develop new design approaches are only welcome if they demonstrate novel user-implemented computational methods. Mining, petroleum, or transportation engineering topics are usually discouraged as they align more closely with other journals. Since the journal is willing to accept longer papers if justified, authors are asked to avoid two-part submissions.

Original contributions in the emerging areas of Machine Learning and Data Science are now welcome. Submissions should have a focus on geotechnical engineering problems and should provide either i) advances in foundational algorithms and computational frameworks or ii) innovative applications of physics-informed AI/ML techniques. Research results are sought that leverage the integration of observational data, fundamental physical laws and our domain knowledge in geomechanics and geotechnical engineering to offer new physical insights, uncover hidden intrinsic physical laws, and create new knowledge for both geotechnical researchers and practitioners.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"Asian Geotechnical Engineering Current Awareness Service, Applied Mechanics Reviews, Engineering Index, Geotechnical Abstracts, Institute of Mining and Metallurgy Abstracts, Engineering Village - GEOBASE, Current Contents - Engineering, Computing & Technology, Web of Science, Research Alert, INSPEC, Scopus, Science Citation Index Expanded"}

Examples of DEDSs include manufacturing plants, communication networks, computer systems, management information databases, logistics systems, command-control-communication systems, robotics, and other man-made operational systems. The state processes of such systems cannot be described by differential equations in general. The aim of this journal, Discrete Event Dynamic Systems: Theory and Applications, is to publish high-quality, peer-reviewed papers on the modeling and control of, and all other aspects related to, DEDSs. In particular, the journal publishes papers dealing with general theories and methodologies of DEDSs and their applications to any particular subject, including hybrid systems, as well as papers discussing practical problems from which some generally applicable DEDS theories or methodologies can be formulated; The scope of this journal is defined by its emphasis on discrete events and the dynamic nature of the systems and on their modeling, control and optimization.

Motivation. The Journal welcomes papers describing modeling and control problems with discrete events from all areas of engineering and sciences. The development of the theory of DEDS must continuously be motivated by concrete problems. The term "problem" is interpreted here in a broad sense to include not only problems from the real world but also well-defined problems arising from the methodological context. As a scientific and engineering discipline, DEDS must have both experimental and theoretical components. Carefully designed experiments accumulate evidence upon which a relevant theory can be built. Conversely, analytical and mathematical reasoning pinpoint further experiments to be conducted for theory validation and extension. The Journal shall encourage papers emphasizing this interplay between modeling, experimentation, and mathematical theory. It is not devoted exclusively to the mathematics of DEDS. The Journal aims at providing a science and engineering knowledge base for the studies of DEDS.
Dynamics of Discrete Event Systems. Recognition of the role of "dynamics" in DEDSs seems crucial for the eventual development of a fruitful theory. While the analysis of DEDS may proceed via many fronts, such as graph theory, queueing theory, simulation, automata, Petri nets, etc., concepts from system theory are expected to play a central role.
Control and Optimization. Most real-world DEDS are "man-made" to serve specific purposes, and, thus, they require control and/or management. Theoretical concepts, such as feedback, stability, and optimality, as well as implementation issues, such as software and languages, will all receive attention.
Interface with Operations Research and Computer Science. It is expected that the future developments of DEDS will continue to involve and be impacted by developments in OR and CS. This journal also welcomes papers dealing with issues at these intersections.
The journal welcomes submissions on all aspects of DEDS, including but not restricted to: theory and formal models (supervisory control, Petri-Nets, Min-Max-plus algebra, DEDS specification, or simulation formalisms), performance analysis, optimization, and optimal control (perturbation analysis, control synthesis, sample-path-based approaches, AI-based learning schemes, scalable solutions to large and complex systems), and applications (case studies and software engineering).", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"ACM Digital Library, BFI List, Baidu, CLOCKSS, CNKI, CNPIEC, Current Contents/Engineering, Computing and Technology, DBLP, Dimensions, EBSCO Applied Science & Technology Source, EBSCO Computers & Applied Sciences Complete, EBSCO Discovery Service, EI Compendex, Google Scholar, Japanese Science and Technology Agency (JST), Journal Citation Reports/Science Edition, Mathematical Reviews, Naver, OCLC WorldCat Discovery Service, Portico, ProQuest Advanced Technologies & Aerospace Database, ProQuest-ExLibris Primo, ProQuest-ExLibris Summon, SCImago, SCOPUS, Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), TD Net Discovery Service, UGC-CARE List (India), Wanfang, zbMATH"}

Over the last decade, it has become clear that empirical studies are a fundamental component of software engineering research and practice: Software development practices and technologies must be investigated by empirical means in order to be understood, evaluated, and deployed in proper contexts. This stems from the observation that higher software quality and productivity is more likely to be achieved if well-understood, tested practices and technologies are introduced in software development.

Reported empirical studies usually involve the collection and analysis of data and experience that can be used to characterize, evaluate and reveal relationships between software development deliverables, practices, and technologies. Over time, it is expected that such empirical results will form a body of knowledge leading to widely accepted and well-formed theories.

This new journal shall publish articles covering all technical aspects of energy process engineering from different perspectives, e.g.,

new concepts of energy generation and conversion;
design, operation, control, and optimization of processes for energy generation (e.g., carbon capture) and conversion of energy carriers;
improvement of existing processes;
combination of single components to systems for energy generation;
design of systems for energy storage;
production processes of fuels, e.g., hydrogen, electricity, petroleum, biobased fuels;
concepts and design of devices for energy distribution.
Fossil fuels are a limited resource, where during the last 250 years humankind has released a large quantity of carbon (in the form of carbon dioxide) that our planet had taken about 250 million years to sequester. Both concerns of energy sustainability as well as concerns about the effects of climate change are leading to the investigation of new energy sources with newfound urgency. Renewable energy sources, for instance wind and solar energy, are under rapid development and the first generations are already being commercialized. Due to the unsynchronized timing of energy supply and demand as well as new concepts for transportation technologies, energy storage is becoming an ever more important topic, too. However, traditional energy sources will continue to be a significant portion of our energy supply for the foreseeable future, and the improvement of these existing processes as well as renewable concepts for fuel development are also topics of central importance. Once this energy is generated, improvements in the efficient use and distribution of this energy have the potential to make a large impact closer to the point of use.

Energy Technology is inherently interdisciplinary: important progress is made in fields ranging from process engineering (for biomass conversion and improved combustion) and electrical engineering (for power conversion and developing smart grids) to materials science and chemistry for next-generations photovoltaic devices, batteries, and fuel-cell technology. Energy Technology is well positioned as an international, interdisciplinary journal to record the progress in this field and act as a valuable resource for the energy technology community for years to come. A global energy transition is on the agenda of most governments in developed countries in order to develop a secure and sustainable energy supply, and the global energy demand is still increasing as the demand from emerging nations continues to catch up.

Environmental geochemistry and health establishes and explains links between the natural or disturbed chemical composition of the earths surface and the health of plants, animals and people.

 

Beneficial elements regulate or promote enzymatic and hormonal activity whereas other elements may be toxic. Bedrock geochemistry controls the composition of soil and hence that of water and vegetation. Environmental issues, such as pollution,  arising from the extraction and use of mineral resources, are discussed. The effects of contaminants introduced into the earths geochemical systems are examined.  Geochemical surveys of soil, water and plants show how major and trace elements are distributed geographically. Associated epidemiological studies reveal the possibility of causal links between the natural or disturbed geochemical environment and disease. Experimental research illuminates the nature or consequences of natural or disturbed geochemical processes.

 

The journal particularly welcomes novel research linking environmental geochemistry and health issues on such topics as: heavy metals (including mercury), persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and mixed chemicals emitted through human activities, such as uncontrolled recycling of electronic-waste; waste recycling; surface-atmospheric interaction processes (natural and anthropogenic emissions, vertical transport, deposition, and physical-chemical interaction) of gases and aerosols;  phytoremediation/restoration of  contaminated sites; food contamination and safety; environmental effects of medicines; effects and toxicity of mixed pollutants; speciation of heavy metals/metalloids;  effects of  mining;   disturbed geochemistry from human behavior, natural or man-made hazards;  particle and nanoparticle toxicology; risk and the vulnerability of populations, etc.

 

Examples of topics that can be the basis for exploring the links between natural or disturbed geochemistry and health include:

I. Compound/Class Based: PAHs; arsenic; bisphenol A; alkylphenols; parabens; phthalates; PBDEs; TBTs; PFOA/PFOS; heavy metals; etc.

 

II. Product Based: Pb in paints; artificial fertilizers; Cd fertilizers; pharmaceuticals; personal care products; illicit drugs; food safety:  additives-e.g., melamine in milk; toxins in the food chain; etc.

 

III. Effect Based: endocrine disruption, etc.

 

IV. Process Based: waste-recycling; E-waste;  environmental legacy of war and conflict; effects of mining and mine wastes/drainage; sewage sludge/biosolids; open burning (particularly open burning of biomass); fracking (hydraulic fracturing); health effects of geochemical changes due to natural or man-made disasters/hazards, e.g., hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, oil spills, climate change, acid rain, etc., or from geochemical  changes introduced by human behaviour, e.g., urbanization issues, transport, social behaviour, mass-consumerism, etc.

Evolving systems are inspired by the idea of system model evolution in a dynamically changing and evolving environment. In contrast to the standard approach in machine learning, mathematical modelling and related disciplines where the model structure is assumed and fixed a priori and the problem is focused on parametric optimisation, evolving systems allow the model structure to gradually change/evolve. The aim of such continuous or life-long learning and domain adaptation is self-organization. It can adapt to new data patterns, is more suitable for streaming data, transfer learning and can recognise and learn from unknown and unpredictable data patterns. Such properties are critically important for autonomous, robotic systems that continue to learn and adapt after they are being designed (at run time).

Evolving Systems solicits publications that address the problems of all aspects of system modelling, clustering, classification, prediction and control in non-stationary, unpredictable environments and describe new methods and approaches for their design.

FSI Digital Investigation covers a broad array of subjects related to crime and security throughout the computerized world. The primary pillar of this publication is digital evidence and multimedia, with the core qualities of provenance, integrity and authenticity. This publication promotes advances in investigating cybercrimes, cyberattacks and traditional crimes involving digital evidence, using scientific practices in digital investigations, and reducing the use of technology for criminal purposes.

This widely referenced publication promotes innovations and advances in utilizing digital evidence and multimedia for legal purposes, including criminal justice, incident response, cybercrime analysis, cyber-risk management, civil and regulatory matters, and privacy protection. Relevant research areas include forensic science, computer science, data science, artificial intelligence, and smart technology.This journal is used by investigative agencies and forensic laboratories, computer security teams, practitioners, researchers, developers, and lawyers from industry, law enforcement, government, academia, and the military to share their knowledge and experiences, including current challenges and lessons learned in the following areas:Research and development: Novel research and development in forensic science, computer science, data science, and artificial intelligence applied to digital evidence and multimedia. New methods to deal with challenges in digital investigations, including applied research into analysing digital evidence and multimedia, exploiting specific technologies, and into preparing for and responding to computer security incidents.Cyber-criminal investigation: develop new methods of online investigation and analysis of financially motivated cyber-crime such as banking Trojans, phishing, ransomware and other forms of cyber-fraud. In addition, researching future criminal activity involving peer-to-peer payments and crypto currencies.Cyber-risk management: Improved ways of using digital evidence to address security breaches involving information systems, methods to find zero day attacks and to perform cyber threat intelligence. The techniques and findings of digital investigations are essential in drawing post-incident conclusions, which are vital feedback components of the security policy development process, and managing risk appetite.Case Notes: Brief investigative case studies with practical examples of how digital evidence is being used in digital investigations, forensic analysis, and incident response. Case Notes can also describe current challenges that practitioners are facing in cybercrime and computer security, highlighting areas that require further research, development or legislation. The format for Case Notes is simple and short: case background, any technical or legal challenges, the digital evidence and multimedia involved, processes and/or tools used, and outcomes (e.g., solutions, barriers, need for R%ampD). Please check the following example for preferred Case Note format: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742287618301713.Scientific practices: Novel approaches to strengthening the scientific foundation and rigor of digital investigations, and to increasing the reliability of and confidence in processes, analysis methods, results, and conclusions involving digital evidence and multimedia.Effective practices: Studies that assess new practices in digital investigations and propose effective approaches to handling and processing digital evidence.Survey papers: Discussion of current methods and future needs relevant to digital investigations, including analysing digital evidence and multimedia from computers, smart technology, mobile phones, memory, malware, network traffic, as well as systems that support enterprises, telecommunications, and satellites. In addition, advanced approaches to analysing digital evidence and multimedia, including novel applications of artificial intelligence and data analytics.Application analysis: Novel approaches to analysing applications on mobile devices and computers from a digital forensic perspective. Analysis may include configuration and log data, network telemetry and cloud storage, live memory artifacts, and indications of compromised and abused applications. Proposed methods should go beyond a single version of an application and be generalized to multiple versions of an application, or a general category of applications (e.g. social networking), on multiple platforms (Android, iOS). In addition, strong work in this area will extend the functionality of an existing open source tool, or provide a new open source tool. Also of interest are approaches to performing validation and quality assurance of forensic software that must be updated frequently to support new applications. Such papers should be structured around investigative questions that are commonly encountered in digital investigations, concentrating on the users and their activities rather than only on technical elements.Tool reviews: Evaluation and comparison of specialized software and hardware used to preserve, survey, examine, analyse or present digital evidence and multimedia, deepening our understanding of specific tools, and highlight any needed enhancements.Future challenges: Analysis of new technologies, vulnerabilities and exploits which may create opportunities for criminality and/or computer security incidents, but which require further work in order to determine how their use can be investigated and the evidential opportunities they may create.Registered reports: Studies that assess methods critically, and evaluating the reliability, statistical power, and reproducibility of results. Such reports can include tests and experiments with negative results, not just positive.Legal analysis and updates: Carefully considered commentary by legal experts on recent cases involving digital evidence and multimedia, forensic applications and computer security risk management, relevant legal developments, privacy issues, and legislative limitations.Evidence accessibility: exploring safe, fair, and feasible methods of acquiring digital evidence from protected sources such as DRM, encrypted traffic, encrypted storage, and locked proprietary devices, while taking individual privacy and ethical aspects into consideration.Author Note: General methods for detecting forgery in digital photographs or videos are not within scope of Forensic Science International: Digital Investigation, and will be rejected without review. To be within scope of this Journal, any novel forgery detection method must be evaluated using datasets that are representative of actual digital investigations. In addition, improvements over existing methods must be clearly demonstrated. It is recommended that authors provide a working implementation of their proposed method to enable others to test it using their own datasets for comparison with existing methods.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"Web of Science, Current Contents, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Scopus"}

The term "formal methods" has been applied to a range of notations, theories and tools.

Indeed, it is interesting to note that once something is adopted into practical use it is no longer thought of as a formal method. Apart from widely used notations such as those for syntax and state machines, there have been significant applications of specification notations, development methods and tools both for proving general results and for searching for specific conditions. However, the most profound and lasting influence of the formal approach is the way it has illuminated fundamental concepts like those of communication.


In this spirit, the principal aim of FAC is to promote the growth of computing science, to show its relation to practice and to stimulate applications of apposite formalisms to practical problems. One significant challenge is to show how a range of formal models can be related to each other.

The theory of fuzzy sets now encompasses a well organized corpus of basic notions including (and not restricted to) aggregation operations, a generalized theory of relations, specific measures of information content, a calculus of fuzzy numbers. Fuzzy sets are also the cornerstone of a non-additive uncertainty theory, namely possibility theory, and of a versatile tool for both linguistic and numerical modeling: fuzzy rule-based systems. Numerous works now combine fuzzy concepts with other scientific disciplines as well as modern technologies.

In mathematics fuzzy sets have triggered new research topics in connection with category theory, topology, algebra, analysis. Fuzzy sets are also part of a recent trend in the study of generalized measures and integrals, and are combined with statistical methods. Furthermore, fuzzy sets have strong logical underpinnings in the tradition of many-valued logics.

Fuzzy set-based techniques are also an important ingredient in the development of information technologies. In the field of information processing fuzzy sets are important in clustering, data analysis and data fusion, pattern recognition and computer vision. Fuzzy rule-based modeling has been combined with other techniques such as neural nets and evolutionary computing and applied to systems and control engineering, with applications to robotics, complex process control and supervision. In thefield of information systems, fuzzy sets play a role in the development of intelligent and flexible manBmachine interfaces and the storage of imprecise linguistic information. In Artificial Intelligence various forms of knowledge representation and automated reasoning frameworks benefit from fuzzy set-based techniques, for instance in interpolative reasoning, non-monotonic reasoning, diagnosis, logic programming, constraint-directed reasoning, etc. Fuzzy expert systems have been devised for fault diagnosis,and also in medical science. In decision and organization sciences, fuzzy sets has had a great impact in preference modeling and multicriteria evaluation, and has helped bringing optimization techniques closer to the users needs. Applications can be found in many areas such as management, production research, and finance. Moreover concepts and methods of fuzzy set theory have attracted scientists in many other disciplines pertaining to human-oriented studies such as cognitive psychology and some aspects of social sciences.

The scope of the journal Fuzzy Sets and Systems has expanded so as to account for all facets of the field while emphasizing its specificity as bridging the gap between the flexibility of human representations and the precision and clarity of mathematical or computerized representations, be they numerical or symbolic.

The journal welcomes original and significant contributions in the area of Fuzzy Sets whether on empirical or mathematical foundations, or their applications to any domain of information technology, and more generally to any field of investigation where fuzzy sets are relevant. Applied papers demonstrating the usefulness of fuzzy methodology in practical problems are particularly welcome.

Special attention is given to concepts and developments of new energy geotechnologies that comprise intrinsic mechanisms protecting the environment against a potential engineering induced damage, hence warranting sustainable usage of energy resources.

The scope of the journal is broad, including fundamental concepts in geomechanics and mechanics of porous media, the experiments and analysis of novel phenomena and applications. Of special interest are issues resulting from coupling of particular physics, chemistry and biology of external forcings, as well as of pore fluid/gas and minerals to the solid mechanics of the medium skeleton and pore fluid mechanics. The multi-scale and inter-scale interactions between the phenomena and the behavior representations are also of particular interest. Contributions to general theoretical approach to these issues, but of potential reference to geomechanics in its context of energy and the environment are also most welcome.

The purpose of the Journal is to foster scientific understanding of various processes in geomaterials, both induced by technology and natural, and their relationship to the underlying mechanisms. The intrinsic nature of coupling of chemical, biological, thermal and mechanical properties, variables and fields distinguishes the related problems from those in classical geomechanics. Thus, emphasis is placed on the development and fusion of fundamental concepts in mechanics, physics, geochemistry and geo-biology and applications of such concepts to novel technologies related to geological energy production and storage as well as to the prevention of the damage to the environment, in which solid and fluid mechanics of geomaterials is of relevance.

The underlying theme is that uncertainties associated with geomaterials (soils, rocks), geologic processes, and possible subsequent treatments, are usually large and complex and these uncertainties play an indispensable role in the risk assessment and management of engineered and natural systems. Significant theoretical and practical challenges remain on quantifying these uncertainties and developing defensible risk management methodologies that are acceptable to decision makers and stakeholders. Many opportunities to leverage on the rapid advancement in Bayesian analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other data-driven methods also exist, which can greatly enhance our decision-making abilities.

The basic goal of this international peer-reviewed journal is to provide a multi-disciplinary scientific forum for cross fertilization of ideas between interested parties working on various aspects of georisk to advance the state-of-the-art and the state-of-the-practice. Besides acting as a focused forum and promoting integration between disciplines, other key features of this journal include:
Fostering dissemination of information between research and practice.
Encouraging practice-oriented papers.
Encouraging papers reporting actual statistics with supporting databases.
Encouraging papers developing modern data-driven methods that can derive deep insights from real-world multivariate, incomplete, and uncertain data.
Including occasional educational papers that would enhance the knowledge and understanding of the non-specialist.
Including cross-disciplinary papers that enhance the social and behavioral dimensions in risk dialogue between scientists, policy makers, and the public for improving risk communications and promoting a more balanced risk debate in general.

As the use of geotextile fabrics has expanded there has been the introduction of geotextile composites and the development of products such as geogrids and meshes. Overall these materials are referred to as geotextiles and related products. All have a wide range of applications and are currently used to advantage in many civil engineering applications including roads, airfields, railroads, embankments, retaining structures, reservoirs, canals, dams, bank protection and coastal engineering.

Geomembranes are impermeable membranes used widely as cut-offs and liners. Until recent years, geomembranes were used mostly as canal and pond liners; however, one of the largest current applications is to the containment of hazardous or municipal wastes and their leachates. In many of these applications geomembranes are employed with geotextile or mesh underliners which reinforce or protect the more flexible geomembrane whilst also acting as an escape route for gases and leachates generated in certain wastes.

The range of products and their applications has expanded rapidly over the last decade with geotextiles and geomembranes being specified world wide. This rapid growth is paralleled by a virtual explosion of technology. Current reference books and even manufacturers' sponsored publications tend to date very quickly and the need for a vehicle to bring together and discuss the growing body of technology now available has become evident.

Geotextiles and Geomembranes fills this need and provides a forum for the dissemination of information amongst research workers, designers, users and manufacturers. By providing a growing fund of information the journal increases general awareness, prompts further research and assists in the establishment of international codes and regulations.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"Fluid Abstracts, Geographical Abstracts: Physical Geography, Geological Abstracts, Current Contents, GeoSciTech, Applied Mechanics Reviews, Engineering Village - GEOBASE, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, Engineering Index, Geotechnical Abstracts, Web of Science, INSPEC, Scopus, Science Citation Index Expanded"}

on fundamental research in human-computer interaction. The goal of HCI is to be a journal
of the highest quality that combines the best research and design work to extend our
understanding of human-computer interaction. The target audience is the research
community with an interest in both the scientific implications and practical relevance of
how interactive computer systems should be designed and how they are actually used. HCI is
concerned with the theoretical, empirical, and methodological issues of interaction science
and system design as it affects the user.
Interaction Science. HCI seeks to foster a scientific understanding of the cognitive and
social behavior of system users and the organizational and social impacts of that usage.
Studies of usage can cover individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and networks,
as well as societal impacts of system use. We encourage theoretical, empirical and
methodological contributions. Theoretical papers should deal with scientific models of user
learning or performance, or with social models of the user community. Empirical papers
may range from quantitative controlled laboratory experimentation to field observation
using qualitative methods. Methodological papers should analyze and study research
methods.
System Design. HCI seeks to foster rational discussion of, and methods for, the design of
computer systems and the evaluation of existing systems. HCI is interested in a range of
issues from new user-interface techniques to the process of system design. Theoretical
papers should deal with design principles underlying a particular system or class of
systems, or with different approaches to designing interactive systems. Empirical papers
may assess existing or novel interaction techniques, or examine the design process itself.
Methodological papers should deal with the application of design principles, the
rationalization of design alternatives, or the role of empirical methods in the design
process.
HCI is interested in original papers of high quality and broad relevance within the above
framework. Papers may cover any domain in which interactive systems are involved --
personal tools, group systems, social tools, organizational systems, instructional and
training systems, games, robots, design tools and systems, productivity tools, other interactive tools and applications, user-oriented programming tools and methods, and so
on.
HCI is a multidisciplinary journal, so papers must have scientific implications, system
design implications, and analyses of how systems are actually used. HCI favors substantial
papers dealing with extended programs of research and design. HCI is not interested in
narrow papers focusing on issues of limited or only specialized interest or in papers
reporting only preliminary results. Theoretical papoers, framework papers, review
papers, and even essays are welcomed; but they are expected to present a rigorous analysis
developing new conceptual views or codifications of existing materials that imply future
research directions. Papers articulating new or non-standard perspectives are also
actively encouraged. HCI aims to foster discussion in the research community and
welcomes commentaries that reflect on, critique, or extend existing published HCI papers.

This does not include traditional software concerns such as object-oriented or structured programming, or Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) or Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) standards. The magazine may, however, treat the intersection of these software technologies with the Web or agents.

This magazine is not focused on intelligent systems. Techniques for encoding knowledge or breakthroughs in neural net technologies are outside its scope, as would be an article on the efficacy of a particular expert system. Internet Computing focuses on technologies and applications that allow practitioners to leverage off services to be found on the Internet. Agents are one technology for doing so, independent of claims about intelligence. In fact, most of the useful agent technology being deployed on the Internet is distinct from the multi-user agent technology developed in the AI world. The latter typically focuses on architectures supporting beliefs, intentions, and other human-like characteristics. Such characteristics are typically not relevant to Internet agents. More important are system engineering issues such as Internet mobility, shared protocols, ontologies, registration, and routing.

The measurement and understanding of the reliability of such entities at each phase, from the concept stage through research and development and into manufacturing scale-up, provides the overall database on the reliability of the devices, materials, processes, package and other necessities for the successful introduction of a product to market. This reliability database is the foundation for a quality product, which meets customer expectations. A product so developed has high reliability. High quality will be achieved because product weaknesses will have been found (root cause analysis) and designed out of the final product. This process of ever increasing reliability and quality will result in a superior product. In the end, reliability and quality are not one thing; but in a sense everything, which can be or has to be done to guarantee that the product successfully performs in the field under customer conditions. Our goal is to capture these advances. An additional objective is to focus cross fertilized communication in the state of the art of reliability of electronic materials and devices and provide fundamental understanding of basic phenomena that affect reliability. In addition, the publication is a forum for interdisciplinary studies on reliability.

All renewable energy generation technologies are within the scope of the journal. Specific technology areas covered by the journal include:

Wind power technology and systems
Photovoltaics
Solar thermal power generation
Geothermal energy
Fuel cells
Wave power
Marine current energy
Biomass conversion and power generation
What differentiates RPG from technology specific journals is a concern with power generation and how the characteristics of the different renewable sources affect electrical power conversion, including power electronic design, integration in to power systems, and techno-economic issues. Other technologies that have a direct role in sustainable power generation such as fuel cells and energy storage are also covered, as are system control approaches such as demand side management, which facilitate the integration of renewable sources into power systems, both large and small.

The journal provides a forum for the presentation of new research, development and applications of renewable power generation. Demonstrations and experimentally based research are particularly valued, and modelling studies should as far as possible be validated so as to give confidence that the models are representative of real-world behavior. Research that explores issues where the characteristics of the renewable energy source and their control impact on the power conversion is welcome. Papers covering the wider areas of power system control and operation, including scheduling and protection that are central to the challenge of renewable power integration are particularly encouraged.

The journal is technology focused covering design, demonstration, modelling and analysis, but papers covering techno-economic issues are also of interest. Papers presenting new modelling and theory are welcome but this must be relevant to real power systems and power generation. Most papers are expected to include significant novelty of approach or application that has general applicability, and where appropriate include experimental results. Critical reviews of relevant topics are also invited and these would be expected to be comprehensive and fully referenced.

The frontiers of biological, medical, and healthcare research depend on sophisticated modeling, analysis, and computational techniques. Operations research, including all aspects of optimization, stochastic processes, and simulation, are vital tools for investigating complex biological systems, advanced medical procedures, and healthcare delivery processes. In turn, the computational challenges associated with these applications have spawned new developments in operations research, creating a synergy of application, theory, and implementation.

Submissions that include advancements in OR methodology for addressing a problem in biology, medicine, and/or healthcare are welcome. In addition, we welcome submissions presenting innovative applications of existing OR methodologies to address new problems in their respective domains. Submissions should include aspects of biology/medicine/healthcare, operations research/management science, and computer science/computing. Accepted papers will provide a significant contribution in one of these three aspects or possibly provide a contribution in some combination of the three. Accordingly, reviewers may be selected from multiple disciplines to provide complementary perspectives in evaluating submissions.

Examples of computational OR applied to biology/medicine/healthcare:

computational OR methods for improving healthcare delivery
development of OR-based machine learning algorithms for biomedical data
scheduling of healthcare workers and patients
advancements in the use of optimization for radiation treatment therapy
modeling of infection control and antibiotic stewardship programs

Rapid advances in computing technology have permitted the solution of increasingly large and complex operations research models. As a consequence, much greater attention must be paid to formulation and modeling issues. This includes the need to understand how to model complex problems effectively, how to compare formulations, and how to find the proper tradeoffs between model fidelity and the required computational resources to solve it. The area also covers the need for novel techniques and tools for acquiring, formulating, debugging, analyzing, and visualizing models. Modeling Methods and Model Analysis are the two main overlapping themes in this very broad area:

Modeling Methods covers research on ways of creating and managing Operations research model, which features a significant computational component. It includes computational techniques to model uncertainty, represent complex data sets and solutions, and capture complex decisions, objectives, and constraints. It also covers techniques to acquire constraints and elucidate preferences, algebraic modeling languages, and graphical representations. Moreover, this theme includes how to formulate and compare models for highly complex applications, trading off model fidelity and computational requirements.
Model Analysis covers research on ways to analyze models and model instances to provide useful insights. Examples include computational methods and tools for explaining, debugging, visualizing, and analyzing models. It also covers techniques for reformulating and simplifying models, and for infeasibility analysis.

In our increasingly information-based economy and society, data-driven decision-making and data-driven automation have become central to most human endeavors. Data Science is rooted in the domain of data-driven decision-making and Machine Learning is centered on data-driven automation. Data Science spans the four dimensions of the analytics field  diagnostic, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. Similarly, Machine Learning is focused on modeling data, learning from data, and applying them in the automation of processes. Although their target application domains could be different, Data Science and Machine Learning employ similar models, algorithms, and systems, and both are well established in the underlying disciplines of statistics, optimization, and computer science. A common thread that unifies the two fields is their consistent thrust on extracting knowledge and insights from possibly noisy data, and applying this knowledge and data-supported insights to solve both structured and ill-structured problems in a variety of application domains. The explosive growth in the fields of statistical modeling, optimization, algorithm design, and computing systems have greatly enhanced the scope and reach of Data Science and Machine Learning in contemporary economy and society.

The Data Science & Machine Learning (DSML) area provides a forum for publication of papers on the cutting edge of these rapidly evolving disciplines. The area welcomes innovative contributions with a strong emphasis on analytical modeling, algorithmic development, and computational experimentation leading to validation. Given the multi-disciplinary scope of the journal focusing on the interface of computer science, information systems, and operations research, topics that are most appropriate include:

Data modeling and learning approaches that demonstrate significant performance or functionality improvements
Methods for efficiently managing distributed data or knowledge
Innovations in the use of DSML methodologies in important application domains (to name a few, consumer behavior, preference analysis, social media, financial technologies, GIS, agent-based applications)
Innovations in DSML methodologies leading to novel and superior solutions to both structured and ill-structured problems (to name a few, data mining, link prediction, knowledge discovery, graph modeling, topic modeling, statistical modeling)
Advances in methods for analyzing performance of DSML systems

The Design & Analysis of Algorithms Areas seek to publish significant contributions to the algorithmic aspects of operations research. The development of algorithms for optimization problems is a vibrant field due to the need, on one hand, to develop general-purpose solvers capable to tackle as large as possible classes of optimization problems, and, on the other hand, to exploit as much as possible the structure of the problem at hand to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach. This is especially relevant when the problems are of large scale and/or tight constraints are imposed on the available computational resources, as it happens in many applications. Although a single objective function is most often considered, solutions methods for multi-objective optimization problems, equilibria/variational ones and games are also welcome.

Thus, the design of algorithms covers a broad spectrum of issues, ranging from the study of the complexity or approximability of a problem to an algorithmic engineering project involving high-performance computing platforms, advanced data structures, and real-life data. The analysis of algorithms may concern all the nontrivial aspects related to their completeness, correctness, and efficiency as expressed by the trade-off between the solution quality they deliver and the amount of computational resources they require, estimated by either theoretical (worst-case or probabilistic) or experimental means.

In principle, algorithms covering all possible applications (resource allocation, facility location, routing and scheduling, energy, transportation, finance, just to mention a few) and of all possible types (exact, heuristic, continuous, combinatorial, etc.) are welcome in these two areas, subject to the specificities of each detailed below. However, other areas of the Journal focus on either specific applications (Biology, Medicine, & Healthcare; Knowledge Management & Machine Learning; Network Optimization) or on specific solution techniques (Stochastic Models; Heuristic Search; Simulation). In general, a research paper should be submitted to the Design & Analysis of Algorithms Area if the algorithm is designed either for a quite general class of problems (although it can be motivated and applied to specific cases), or for an application not covered by another specific area; otherwise, it should go to the more specific area.

Also, the two individual areas

Design and Analysis of Algorithms: Continuous
Design and Analysis of Algorithms: Discrete
have a very significant intersection, in particular that of algorithms for Mixed-Integer Non Linear Problems that inherently require to tackle both their continuous and their discrete aspects. In this case, the contribution should go to the area that, to the judgement of the authors, is the most fitting one, with knowledge that the Area Editors may override this decision.

Design and Analysis of Algorithms: Continuous
This area actually covers algorithms for three possibly different kinds of approaches:

exact algorithms for continuous problems whose global optimality can be "easily" demonstrated, typically convex ones;
local algorithms for (nonconvex) continuous problems;
exact algorithms for nonconvex continuous problems whose global optimality is "hard" to establish.
Thus, different aspects can be at play in each case, such as algorithms for very-large-scale convex and even linear programs (with such applications as Machine Learning, stochastic, chance-constrained and robust optimization, and others), rate of local convergence and robustness of nonlinear (nonconvex) algorithms, bounding and/or search techniques for global nonlinear nonconvex optimization. These aspects may, of course, co-exist and interact in a given application; besides, as previously noted, global optimization techniques for nonconvex problems have strong relationships with those for discrete optimization. All research work pertaining to these aspects is welcome to this area regardless of specificities of the problem at hand (class of nonlinear constraints/functions involved, availability and continuity of derivatives, ...) unless the contribution is narrowly focused on some application or methodology for which a more specific area exists.

Design and Analysis of Algorithms: Discrete
This area is the home for

combinatorial,
constraint-based,
logic-based, and
linear-programming-based
exact algorithms for difficult discrete optimization problems.

As anticipated in the part of editorial statement in common with the Continuous Area, algorithms for Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Optimization are especially welcome and the responsibility of this topic will be shared.

We are particularly interested in hybrid algorithms combining several of the above techniques to achieve computational effectiveness.

Finally, we especially value the generality of the proposed algorithm, thus the applicability of a technique within general-purpose solvers and its effective implementation. Examples are cutting plane generation, branching rules, preprocessing and filtering techniques, etc. that can be used to enhance the computational performances of general purpose methods / solvers.

Heuristic Search & Approximation Algorithms
Erwin Pesch
Economics and Business Administration
University of Siegen
Siegen, Germany
erwin.pesch@uni-siegen.de

This area focuses on the design, learning, and application of efficient and innovative methods for approximately solving relevant, difficult (combinatorial) optimization problems. In particular, it covers topics such as approximation algorithms with performance guarantee, (fully) polynomial time approximation schemes, parameterized algorithms, and heuristics. New ideas in rounding data and dynamic programming, deterministic or randomized rounding of linear programs, greedy, nature-inspired and local search algorithms, neural networks, and constrained programming-based learning, or hybrid approaches combining existing heuristic methods, alone or in conjunction with techniques from other areas of operations research or computer science, are also of particular interest. The emphasis within the area is on papers presenting methodological innovations that can be applied to a wide range of problems or situations and include a proof of performance. Papers must clearly elaborate the innovation either in modeling, or a new solution approach, justified theoretically or via computational comparison with existing methods and/or in a real application. A simple assertion that the innovations can be applied elsewhere does not meet the burden of proof required in good scientific practice. The authors must demonstrate generality in a convincing manner, either experimentally or theoretically. Rarely, it may be clear that a method is broadly important even when it is tested on only one problem, but this would be very unusual.

For many outlets in our field, a necessary and sufficient condition for publication is to show better results than a set of competitors over some test instances. While this may be a reasonable standard in some settings, it is generally insufficient for the INFORMS Journal on Computing, especially given that a significant fraction of our audience are not specialists in heuristic search and learning. Obtaining best-known results will be helpful in making the case for the paper, but it is not normally sufficient.

The problem(s) considered in the paper must be important in some sense, though this is difficult to define precisely and is subject to some tradeoffs. Importance may be demonstrated by application to a problem of practical significance, or demonstration that the problem has been extensively studied in the research literature, for example.

A scientifically rigorous paper presenting methodological innovations that can be applied to a wide range of important problems or situations is not easy to produce. However, it is relatively easy to recognize such a paper. Papers in this category will not generally require multiple major revisions: a paper presenting methodological innovations that can be applied to a wide range of problems or situations does not need a committee to make it perfect. Conversely, the referees generally cannot walk authors through the process of discovering and describing methodological innovations that can be applied to a wide range of problems or situation.

Survey papers covering recent advances in a given field and papers aimed at providing a conceptual integration of the area are also welcome.

Network Optimization: Algorithms & Applications
David L. Alderson
Operations Research Department
Naval Postgraduate School
Monterey, California, USA
dlalders@nps.edu

The Network Optimization Area focuses on networks across the social, physical, and engineering sciences. These include social, telecommunications, and transportation networks. Of primary interest are papers exploring innovative applications of optimization. While novel applications are of potential interest, papers in this area generally make a significant methodological contribution and are accompanied by computational work supporting the contributions.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

Algorithms for optimal design and use of networks;
Network security, survivability, robustness, risk, and resilience;
Game-theoretic representations and analysis;
Network applications in emerging technological areas; and
Case studies involving real, large-scale network problems including published data.
Simulation
Bruno Tuffin
IRISA/INRIA
Campus de Beaulieu
Cedex, France
Bruno.Tuffin@inria.fr

The Simulation Area is interested in research in all computational aspects of simulation. We are looking for high-quality research on the computational aspects of:

Simulation model building (for instance, object-oriented language development)
Simulation data structures (e.g., specialized data structures for simulation models using historical data)
Simulation modeling/experiment environments (such as web-based simulation)
Simulation stochastic input modeling (like Johnson-family or Bzier distribution fitting)
Random-variate generation (for instance, time-series random variate generation)
Output analysis (such as optimal batch-size selection theory and algorithms)
Optimization over small feasible sets (like ranking & selection procedures and multiple-comparison procedures)
Optimization for large feasible sets (such as random search methods)
Optimization over sets containing continuous variables (e.g., likelihood-ratio methods)
Variance-reduction methods for simulation experiments over classes of problems possessing special structure (such as order(s)-of-magnitude variance reduction in Monte Carlo evaluation of financial options)
and other aspects of simulation experiment modeling and analysis.
Tutorials and applications in the above areas that are comprehensive and integrate from multiple sources are also welcome.

Software Tools
Ted Ralphs
Industrial and Systems Engineering
Lehigh University
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, USA
ted@lehigh.edu

Software Tools seeks papers describing software and/or data made available to the research community.

In the case of software, the contribution should be novel with respect to software, but need not necessarily be so with respect to the underlying mathematics or algorithms. The novelty could be in a sophisticated implementation that showcases state-of-the-art techniques, an ingenious abstraction that simplifies an important and previously difficult research task, or a robust implementation of an existing state-of-the-art algorithm where none previously existed. The software should be of high technical quality; follow best practices for software engineering; and be usable, maintainable, and of long-term interest to the research community. The paper should make the case for the novelty of the software, describe how it fits into the literature, and explain clearly how it can be leveraged in solving a computational problem of importance to the research community. The paper should not be a users manual or a technical specification.

In the case of data, the paper should address why the data is important to the research community in advancing research and what methods were used in producing it. The novelty could lie in the way that the data was collected and processed/cleaned (for example, the data may be high velocity or high volume, requiring sophisticated collection techniques), how it was generated, or how the data was integrated into a novel data analytics workflow to solve a problem of high interest. It is likely that any paper addressing data will also address associated software.

An archive of the data and/or software that is the subject of the paper is expected to be made available to the community through the IJOC Github repository (https://INFORMSJoC.github.io) following guidelines described in https://INFORMSJoC.github.io/InstructionsForAuthors.html. Such an archive should be submitted along with the paper for review. There should be some expectation that the software will remain useful in the long-term and it should be released under a license that makes it useful for research.

Both terse papers, briefly describing a software or data contribution and its importance to the research community, and full expository papers are sought. Short papers focused exclusively on the software or data will be subjected to the usual review process, but are not expected to undergo multiple rounds of revisions. Full-length papers must include additional material with enough significance to merit publication. In both cases, the review process will consist of two separate parts: a review of the software/data, to assess the quality and maintainability, and a review of the paper itself, assessing the novelty and potential importance to the research community.

Stochastic Models & Reinforcement Learning
Nicola Secomandi
Tepper School of Business

ns7@andrew.cmu.edu

The Stochastic Models & Reinforcement Learning Area welcomes manuscripts that deal with the computational aspects of models that represent systems in which uncertainty is a central concern and methods that evaluate or optimize the performance of these systems. Computation is a critical dimension in dealing with large-scale stochastic systems that defy exact analytical solution. The challenge is to develop efficient, effective, and reliable algorithms for such systems. Papers of interest develop new such methodologies; conduct novel and insightful analysis of methods; and report on timely, important, and innovative applications based on data or realistic parameter values. The scope of this area includes a variety of topics. Examples include Markovian modeling of stochastic systems; aggregation approaches for Markov chains, such as ones that arise in data-driven applications that feature huge data sets; and reinforcement learning, approximations, and bounding techniques for intractable Markov decision processes and stochastic dynamic programs. (Papers that focus on supervised or unsupervised learning should typically be submitted to one of the other areas of the journal.) Appealing manuscripts deal with models of both traditional and emerging contextual domains, such as inventory, supply-chain, and service management; revenue management, pricing, and market analytics; social networks; energy; and financial engineering, computational finance, and risk management. Clear and concise exposition and rigorous execution are defining elements of successful articles.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"Clarivate Analytics , Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) categories: Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Application, Operations Research & Management Science"}

During submission, please suggest at least one and a maximum of five potential reviewers. You are strongly encouraged to submit recommendations for appropriately senior and knowledgeable referees having no connection to your work and not located at your institution, as this may speed up the processing of your manuscript. The editorial office may not use your suggestions, but they are greatly appreciated. Where the author works in a country with a small community of research workers in his or her field, it is highly desirable that at least two of the suggested referees are from another country.

To be suitable for submission to this Journal, manuscripts should advance the field of Infrared Physics and Technology.
Their target audience should be those working in the field of Infrared Physics and Technology.
Papers using infrared methods, such as FTIR spectroscopy or thermography, in an essentially routine way to advance some other field, and of interest to other readerships, and generally not suited to this Journal.
The Journal does include within its scope genuinely new applications of established infrared methods. In the field of medical applications such as the detection of breast cancer or diabetic pathology, submissions to IRPT should normally include advances in hardware or data collection protocols etc. Such studies are required to have adequate sized and well characterized cohorts. Clinical studies using standard equipment are generally not within the scope of the Journal. Similarly in the fields of hyperspectral imaging and near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy application of standard hardware and signal processing methods to a different agricultural product etc does not normally fall within our scope, whereas novel hardware or signal processing does.

The Journal only publishes papers which are purely based on computer modelling without support from experimental results in exceptional circumstances when there is a clear reason to do so.
These might, for example, include comparative studies of designs for large pieces of equipment such as satellites, FELs etc.
Papers on advances in modelling techniques, appropriately validated, are welcome.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"Current Contents - Physical, Chemical & Earth Sciences, Scopus, INSPEC"}

Manuscripts of articles, technical notes and letters-to-the-editor should be submitted to the Editor-in-Chief via the on-line submission system. Authors wishing to submit an article need to log in on the IJAV website first. Users logged into the website are able to submit new articles, track the status of their articles already submitted, upload revised articles, responses and/or rebuttals to reviewers, figures, biographies, photographs, copyright transfer agreements, and send comments to the editor. Each time the status of an article submitted changes, the author will also be notified automatically by email.

IIAV members (in good standing for at least six months) can publish in IJAV free of charge and their papers will be displayed on-line immediately after they have been edited and laid-out.

Non-IIAV members will be required to pay a mandatory Article Processing Charge (APC) of $200 USD if the manuscript is accepted for publication after review. The APC fee allows IIAV to make your research freely available to all readers using the Open Access model.

In addition, Non-IIAV members who pay an extra voluntary publication fee (EVPF) of $500 USD will be granted expedited publication in the IJAV Journal and their papers can be displayed on the Internet after acceptance. If the $200 USD (APC) publication fee is not honored, papers will not be published. Authors who do not pay the voluntary fixed fee of $500 USD will have their papers published but there may be a considerable delay.

The English text of the papers must be of high quality. If the text submitted is of low quality the manuscript will be more than likely rejected. For authors whose first language is not English, we recommend having their manuscripts reviewed and edited prior to submission by a native English speaker with scientific expertise. There are many commercial editing services which can provide this service at a cost to the authors.

We believe that authors, reviewers and guests will find the new updated IJAV website helpful and easy to use.

The journal will include information on history, methodology, materials, survey, inspection, non-destructive testing, analysis, diagnosis, remedial measures, and strengthening techniques.
Preservation of the architectural heritage is considered a fundamental issue in the life of modern societies. In addition to their historical interest, cultural heritage buildings are valuable because they contribute significantly to the economy by providing key attractions in a context where tourism and leisure are major industries in the 3rd millennium. The need of preserving historical constructions is thus not only a cultural requirement, but also an economical and developmental demand.

The study of historical buildings and other structures must be undertaken from an approach based on the use of modern technologies and science. The final aim must be to select and adequately manage the possible technical means needed to attain the required understanding of the morphology and the structural behavior of the construction and to characterize its repair needs. Modern requirements for an intervention include reversibility, unobtrusiveness, minimum repair, and respect of the original construction, as well as the obvious functional and structural requirements. Restoration operations complying with these principles require a scientific, multidisciplinary approach that comprehends historical understanding, modern non-destructive inspection techniques, and advanced experimental and computer methods of analysis.

Therefore, International Journal of Architectural Heritage covers the main aspects related to the study and repair of existing buildings, including:

Issues on the history of construction and architectural technology
General criteria and methodology for study and intervention
Historical and traditional building techniques
Survey techniques
Non-destructive testing, inspection, and monitoring
Experimental results and laboratory testing
Analytical and numerical approaches
Innovative and traditional materials for repair and restoration
Innovative strategies and techniques for repair and restoration
General remedial measures
Repair and strengthening of structures
Seismic behavior and retrofitting

IJBIC provides the scientific community and industry with a vehicle whereby ideas using two or more conventional and computational intelligence based techniques can be discussed.

Bio-inspired computation is an umbrella term for different computational approaches that are based on principles or models of biological systems. This class of methods, such as evolutionary algorithms, ant colony optimisation, and swarm intelligence, complements traditional techniques in the sense that the former can be applied to large-scale applications where little is known about the underlying problem and where the latter approaches encounter difficulties. Therefore, bio-inspired methods are becoming increasingly important in the face of the complexity of today's demanding applications, and accordingly they have been successfully used in various fields ranging from computer engineering and mechanical engineering to chemical engineering and molecular biology.

IJBIC is especially intended for furthering the overall understanding of new algorithms simulated with various bio-phenomena beyond the current focus, i.e. genetic algorithms, Tabu search, etc. Its objective is improvement in theory and applications of the bio-computation field. Algorithms should therefore be carefully designed and appropriately analysed, and authors are encouraged to assess the statistical validity of their results whenever possible.

Topics covered include
New bio-inspired methodologies coming from
creatures living in nature
artificial society
physical/chemical phenomena
New bio-inspired methodology analysis tools, e.g. rough sets, stochastic processes

Areas relevant to the journal encompass the following general topics and those associated with them:

Behaviour and failure of structures and materials under impact and blast loading
Systems for protection and absorption of impact and blast loading
Terminal ballistics
Dynamic behaviour and failure of materials including plasticity and fracture
Stress waves
Structural crashworthiness
High-rate mechanical and forming processes
Impact, blast and high-rate loading/measurement techniques and their applications
Manuscripts submitted for publication will be subjected to stringent peer review and assessed for their contribution to scientific understanding of phenomena and the response of structures and materials to impact, blast and high-rate loading. Work resulting in fundamental insights that benefit engineering design to accommodate high-rate loading, is relevant to the journal. Well-designed and well-documented experimental studies that advance knowledge in the response of materials and structures subjected to impact, blast and high-rate loading are of relevance and interest. However, they should be accompanied by analysis of the experimental data and appropriate conclusions. The incorporation of analytical modelling and/or numerical simulations to support the experimental findings, will enhance the depth and quality of the research reported and make it more compelling. Manuscripts that focus primarily on mathematics, materials science or computation, with little contribution to the scope of impact dynamics described above, as well as those of a purely descriptive nature lacking in analysis, will be declined. Papers comprising largely parametric studies (e.g. using commercial software), unaccompanied by convincing validation and discussion of implications or applications of results generated, as well as those on novel computational techniques without comparison with established analysis or test data, are also not solicited. In all numerical studies, it is essential to demonstrate that the material parameters used in the simulations truly represent the actual physical properties of the material investigated. Consequently, sufficient description/discussion on how the material parameters were obtained, together with any assumptions, would be necessary. The numerical modelling must also include sufficient information to enable third parties to repeat the simulations. Papers that are essentially case studies or descriptions of designs involving impact or blast loading, as well as dynamic testing which generates copious experimental data without in-depth analysis, should seek publication in journals more directly related to those particular areas.

Papers in the International Journal of Impact Engineering should generally be of interest to those in the aeronautical, civil, mechanical, materials, naval, nuclear, ocean, offshore, and transportation engineering fields, as well as those in other science and engineering branches that deal with various aspects of impact, blast and high-rate loading.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"Science Citation Index, EI Compendex Plus, Current Contents - Engineering, Computing & Technology, Engineering Index, Applied Mechanics Reviews, Materials Science Citation Index, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, International Civil Engineering Abstracts, Metals Abstracts, Scopus, INSPEC, Science Citation Index Expanded"}

Information security builds on computer security and applied cryptography, but also reaches out to other branches of the information sciences. Information security is an important aspect of protecting the information society from a wide variety of threats.

The number and the sizes of international conferences treating information security grow with each passing year, as does the quantity of significant publishable technical work in this area. But much of this work appears too long after the need for it has arisen, if at all, or in journals with specialist readerships not including many of those to whom it would be most valuable. Moreover, we do not have journals covering applications and the implementation of security techniques, topics which are important in industry and the business world.

In this new century, The International Journal of Information Security will provide prompt publication of important technical work in information security, whether theoretical, applicable, or related to implementation.

The intended audience includes any person, whether active in the technology or not, whose interests in communications, commerce, banking, medicine, or other areas of endeavor are affected by information security.

The intended author is a technical specialist with the skill and commitment to presenting recent advances in information security to a broad audience around the world.

The intended review process will be peer review by members of the editorial board, with recourse to outside experts where appropriate.

The scope of the International Journal of Information Security (IJIS) is theory, applications, and implementations of information security. This includes, but is not limited to:

- system security - intrusion detection, secure end systems, secure operating systems, data base security, security infrastructures, security evaluation
- network security - Internet security, firewalls, mobile security, security agents, protocols, anti-virus and anti-hacker measures
- content protection - software protection, tamper resistant software

The research should constitute major achievements in the understanding, modeling or simulation of material forming processes. In this respect forming implies a deliberate deformation of material.

The journal establishes a platform of communication between engineers and scientists, covering all forming processes, including sheet forming, bulk forming, powder forming, forming in near-melt conditions (injection moulding, thixoforming, film blowing etc.), micro-forming, hydro-forming, thermo-forming, incremental forming etc. Other manufacturing technologies like machining and cutting can be included if the focus of the work is on plastic deformations.

All materials (metals, ceramics, polymers, composites, glass, wood, fibre reinforced materials, materials in food processing, biomaterials, nano-materials, shape memory alloys etc.) and approaches (micro-macro modelling, thermo-mechanical modelling, numerical simulation including new and advanced numerical strategies, experimental analysis, inverse analysis, model identification, optimization, design and control of forming tools and machines, wear and friction, mechanical behavior and formability of materials etc.) are concerned.

Papers should describe new forming processes, experiments, models or modelling techniques, related to forming or the relation between process conditions and product properties. In general, simulation results should be validated by experiments unless the focus is purely on novel modelling techniques. New models or modelling techniques should have a broad applicability in forming simulations and should not be restricted to one particular shape.

Results of analytical or numerical models that are not translated into new knowledge or are not supported by experimental validation will not be accepted.

Driven by applications ranging from civil search-and-rescue missions to military surveillance missions, there is a rising level of interest and investment in better vehicle designs, and miniaturized components are enabling many rapid advances.

The need to better understand fundamental aspects of flight for small vehicles has spawned a surge in high quality research in the area of micro air vehicle, or MAV research. These aircraft have a set of constraints which are, in many ways, considerably different from that of traditional aircraft and are often best addressed by a multidisciplinary approach.

Fast-response non-linear controls, nano-structures, integrated propulsion and lift mechanisms, highly flexible structures, and low Reynolds aerodynamics are just a few of the important considerations which may be combined in the execution of MAV research.

The role of the International Journal of Micro Air Vehicles is to provide the scientific and engineering community with a peer-reviewed open access journal dedicated to publishing high-quality technical articles summarizing both fundamental and applied research in this field.

The promise of a single end-to-end technology has not been realized and likely never will occur. The decreasing cost of bandwidth is increasing the possible applications of computer networks and communication systems to entirely new domains. Problems in integrating heterogeneous wired and wireless technologies, ensuring security and quality of service, and reliably operating large-scale systems including the inclusion of cloud computing have all emerged as important topics. The one constant is the need for network management. Challenges in network management have never been greater than they are today. The International Journal of Network Management is the forum for researchers, developers, and practitioners in network management to present their work to an international audience. The journal is dedicated to the dissemination of information, which will enable improved management, operation, and maintenance of computer networks and communication systems. The journal is peer reviewed and publishes original papers (both theoretical and experimental) by leading researchers, practitioners, and consultants from universities, research laboratories, and companies around the world. Issues with thematic or guest-edited special topics typically occur several times per year. Topic areas for the journal are largely defined by the taxonomy for network and service management developed by IFIP WG6.6, together with IEEE-CNOM, the IRTF-NMRG and the Emanics Network of Excellence.

Papers on modeling of finite nonlinear elastic deformation, with similarities to modeling of plastic deformation, are also welcome.

The Journal will contain research papers, review articles, research notes, letters to the editor, and academic advertisements (books, journals, conferences, and symposia). Strain-rate dependent and strain-rate independent constitutive models to predict observed phemonena during quasi-static, dynamic or cyclic thermo-mechanical loading, behaviour of granular or porous solids under high confining pressures and at high temperatures, multiscale modeling of various deformation mechanisms (dislocation, twinning, and phase transformation), and models with capability for predicting the behaviour of composite materials based onknown plastic behaviour of matrix and fibers in such materials, are some examples of the main themes of this journal. Revealing applications of the new models of plasticity, including modelling of the observed phenomena in metal forming processes are also of interest.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"EI Compendex Plus, Current Contents, Chemical Abstracts, International Aerospace Abstracts, Applied Mechanics Reviews, Mechanics, Science Citation Index, IBZ & IBA, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, Engineering Information Abstracts, Engineering Index, Materials Science Citation Index, Science Abstracts, Scopus, INSPEC, Science Citation Index Expanded"}

The ultimate objective of the journal is to disseminate knowledge for improving industrial practice and to strengthen the theoretical base necessary for supporting sound decision making. It provides a forum for the exchange of ideas and the presentation of new developments in theory and application, wherever engineering and technology meet the managerial and economic environment in which industry operates. In character, the journal combines the high standards of a traditional academic approach with the practical value of industrial applications.

Tracing economic and financial consequences in the analysis of the problem and solution reported, belongs to the central theme of the journal. Submissions should strictly follow the Guide for Authors of the journal.

We are interested in publishing high quality survey and review papers in relevant domains. However, we stress that the hurdles for consideration of such papers are high.

Survey and review papers must position themselves clearly in relation to existing related reviews and surveys in the field. Systematic reviews that merely describe publication patterns in a particular field are unlikely to be sent out for review for IJPE.

Refractory metals are defined as metals with melting points higher than 1800 C. These are tungsten, molybdenum, chromium, tantalum, niobium, hafnium, and rhenium, as well as many compounds and alloys based thereupon. Hard materials that are included in the scope of this journal are defined as materials with hardness values higher than 1000 kg/mm2, primarily intended for applications as manufacturing tools or wear resistant components in mechanical systems. Thus they encompass carbides, nitrides and borides of metals, and related compounds. A special focus of this journal is put on the family of hardmetals, which is also known as cemented tungsten carbide, and cermets which are based on titanium carbide and carbonitrides with or without a metal binder. Ceramics and superhard materials including diamond and cubic boron nitride may also be accepted provided the subject material is presented as hard materials as defined above.

The journal seeks contributions that investigate novel alloy design concepts; studies of the relationships between chemical composition, microstructure, and properties; novel methods of characterization and testing, novel methods of synthesis and processing, especially those that result in improved or novel microstructures, leading in turn to improved properties and novel applications. Articles focus on methods and processes that reduce material and energy consumption, hence the cost of these materials will also be considered.

The process technologies may include but are not limited to powder synthesis and production technologies (chemical methods, physical methods such as mechanical ball milling); powder compaction and shaping technologies including die compaction, powder injection molding, and 3D printing; and sintering and consolidation processes such as vacuum sintering, hot isostatic pressing, field assisted sintering, and other advanced hot consolidation techniques. However, manuscripts that focus on processes without a clear explanation on how the process can lead to improved microstructure and properties, or reduction of energy consumption and costs are likely discouraged.

This journal also publishes articles dealing with the deposition process and the microstructure and the measurement of selected properties of coatings, provided the coating consists of a material from the groups defined above, and is applied on the surface of a refractory metal or hard material. For eligibility of such articles the material science aspect of the coatings and if applicable their interrelationship with the properties of the coatings is of prime importance. Papers lacking this focus are usually referred to other journals dedicated to surface coating or machining.

IJRMHM aims to bridge the gap between pure research and the more practical aspects of production and properties. In that IJMHM will continue to provide a medium linking together material scientists, engineers, designers and manufacturers working in this field.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"Science Citation Index, Science Citation Index Expanded, INSPEC, Scopus"}

The focus of the journal is on model based control design approaches rather than heuristic or rule based methods. Papers on neural networks will have to be of exceptional novelty to be considered for the journal.

The International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control aims to encourage the development of analysis and design techniques for uncertain linear and nonlinear systems. The main focus of the journal is on the theory and design of regulating and tracking systems, but related areas such as linear and nonlinear filtering, condition monitoring and fault estimation are included. The physical modelling, simulation and identification of systems that may be uncertain or nonlinear is of interest. Papers are also welcome in the area of multi-agent systems considering coordinated control problems. Papers dealing with the general problem of consensus and synchronization that fail to demonstrate an application and/or include significant novelty will not be considered.

Papers that demonstrate the potential for robust or nonlinear controllers in applications will also be welcome, but such papers must include sufficient novel material. The Journal provides a natural forum for papers on the theory and application of robust control design and estimation techniques, including H or H2 design, multi-objective optimization, and variable structure and sliding mode control design methods. Papers will also be welcome on non-optimal methods of improving the robustness of uncertain systems, such as QFT design methods. Papers on linear and nonlinear model based predictive control algorithms are also encouraged, and those concerned with linear parameter varying, switched or hybrid systems.

All aspects of the theory and techniques used in nonlinear control and estimation are also included ranging from gain scheduling to networked robust or nonlinear control systems. The development of nonlinear compensation and design methods using feedback linearization, back-stepping, Lyapunov based techniques, learning control, cooperative control and agent based systems are all of interest. Contributions are also welcome on numerical algorithms for robust or constrained control, using for example linear matrix inequalities, and on the problems of implementation, such as controller tuning and commissioning. Although the journal focus is on model-based control, papers on model free and data driven methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning will also be welcome if they are relevant to the control design problems for engineering systems.

Modern systems are becoming more and more complex and sophisticated in their demand for performance, reliability and increasing autonomy. Historically, highly analytic and numeric-based methods have sufficed, frequently simplifying the problem to allow analytical tractability. Many manufactured and natural systems (biological, ecological and socio-economic) cannot be adequately represented or analyzed without requiring multiple interacting and interconnected frameworks and a common information-processing framework. A wide range of new theories, methodologies and techniques are required to enable such systems, and thus engineering and integration to deal with these demands.

IJSS therefore encourages original submissions in these areas, with special focus on papers that are strongly novel as well as not being overly applied. Proposals for special issues in cutting-edge areas of systems science are encouraged, and should be discussed with the Editor-in-Chief.

The journal especially welcomes papers aiming at a better understanding of the coupling of local mechanisms and their interactions in larger scale systems.

Papers submitted for publication may contain either experimental results, numerical simulations or discussions of models, and must present a significant scientific contribution.

The fundamental subjects considered within the scope of the journal are:

 Heat and relevant mass transfer at all scales (nano, micro and macro) and in all types of materials (heterogeneous, composites, biological,...) and fluid flow
 Forced, natural or mixed convection in reactive or non-reactive media
 Single or multi-phase fluid flow with or without phase change
 Near-and far-field radiative heat transfer
 Combined modes of heat transfer in complex systems (for example, plasmas, biological or geological systems,?)
 Multiscale modelling.

Manuscripts dedicated to stability analysis studies, or with developed codes, can be considered if their focus is on the physics of heat and mass transfer processes. Experimental validation for the actual problem or a related case is strongly encouraged. They are, however, outside the scope of our journal, if such papers are centered on mathematical developments.

In all cases, the paper must present a physical discussion of the mathematical model and a clear justification of the underlying assumptions.

Papers dedicated to applications in different fields of engineering or natural sciences may be considered provided that they analyze the coupling of heat transfer modes with other mechanisms and their influence on the system's behavior.

The International Journal of Thermal Sciences will not accept papers with the following characteristics:

 Studies which belong to already established specialized journals, such as computational techniques, combustion, thermodynamic cycles,?
 Papers with purely descriptive or empirical content,
 Mere applications of classical equations to complex fluids (e.g. colloidal suspensions) or to the complex combination of basic mechanisms (divided media, external forces,?)
 Numerical simulations without a thorough validation of the code and convergence study,
 Numerical results using commercial CFD codes, unless new insights into the physics of the process are presented. Even in such cases, experimental validation is mandatory for the actual problem.
 Experimental reports without uncertainty analysis or presenting results without error margins,
 Experimental or numerical studies which do not provide a physical interpretation of the observed behavior,
 Studies presenting the global performance of industrial systems,
 Papers on the characterization of materials,
 Statistical techniques describing the process as a black box.

STTT emphasizes work that takes rigorous, semantics-based, and formal approaches to tools and system development. To facilitate technology transfer and to offer a tool-oriented link between academic research and industrial practice, STTT seeks work that applies tools to realistic systems and that considers the broader workflows and tool chains needed to develop systems in industrial contexts.

STTT also aims to build bridges between communities. Tool support for the development of reliable and correct computer systems is of growing importance: many design methodologies, analyses, verification techniques, and associated tools have been developed in different areas of computer science. However, despite some convergence in recent years, the involved areas still have their own culture and terminology, preventing researchers from taking advantage of the results obtained by colleagues in other fields. In fact, even complex tools from a certain field often reflect quite specific mindsets which hinder an open exchange.

In 2020, STTT expanded its focus to include three new areas of emphasis called Themes that aim to break down some of these barriers and that address areas that the editorial board believes are especially open to impact from the rigorous approaches that have long been championed by STTT: (a) Explanation Paradigms Leveraging Algebraic Intuition, (b) Foundations for Mastering Change, and (c) Competitions and Challenges.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"ACM Digital Library, BFI List, Baidu, CLOCKSS, CNKI, CNPIEC, Current Contents/Engineering, Computing and Technology, DBLP, Dimensions, EBSCO Academic Search, EBSCO Applied Science & Technology Source, EBSCO Computer Science Index, EBSCO Computers & Applied Sciences Complete, EBSCO Discovery Service, EBSCO Engineering Source, EBSCO STM Source, EI Compendex, Google Scholar, INSPEC, Japanese Science and Technology Agency (JST), Journal Citation Reports/Science Edition, Naver, OCLC WorldCat Discovery Service, Portico, ProQuest Advanced Technologies & Aerospace Database, ProQuest-ExLibris Primo, ProQuest-ExLibris Summon, SCImago, SCOPUS, Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), TD Net Discovery Service, UGC-CARE List (India), WTI AG, Wanfang"}

JAISE welcomes submissions of scientific papers, which will be peer-reviewed. These articles should be prepared following the journal's official format and submitted through the official online submission system. Scientific research papers make up the core of the issues of JAISE.

JAISE also considers less technical and shorter articles for inclusion, which can be useful for the scientific community:

(a) Short articles reporting on PhD theses recently defended in the technical areas relevant to the journal. Articles in this category are typically expected to be one page long and will contain information like the abstract of the thesis, details of the viva (date, place, members of the examination board) and a photo of the event. This article can be written by the student or by one of the supervisors.

(b) Opinion articles and letters which can help our community to reflect, discuss or encourage debate and joint work in certain areas.

Articles in any of these two categories should also be prepared following the journal's official format, but should not be submitted through the official submissions webpage, but sent directly to either of the co-Editors-in-Chief. These types of papers will not be peer-reviewed. The co-Editors-in-Chief will decide on the inclusion of these articles.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"ACM Digital Library, Applied Science & Technology Source, Compendex, DBLP Bibliography Server, EBSCO Engineering Collection, SciVerse Scopus, Ulrich's Periodicals Directory, Web of Science: Current Contents/Engineering, Computing, and Technology, Web of Science: Journal Citation Reports/Science Edition, Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SciSearch)"}

{"Journal_Name":"JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS", "Publisher":"ELSEVIER , RADARWEG 29, AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS, 1043 NX", "ISSN_eISSN":"0165-2370 / 1873-250X", "WoS_Core_Collection":"Science Citation Index Expanded", "Additional_WoS_Indexes":"Current Contents Engineering, Computing & Technology | Current Contents Physical, Chemical & Earth Sciences | Essential Science Indicators", "Journal_Website":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-analytical-and-applied-pyrolysis#description", "Publication_Frequency":"Bi-monthly", "Aims_and_Scope":"The Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis (JAAP) is devoted to the publication of papers dealing with innovative applications of pyrolysis processes, the characterization of products related to pyrolysis reactions, and investigations of reaction mechanism. To be considered by JAAP, a manuscript should present significant progress in these topics. The novelty must be satisfactorily argued in the cover letter. A manuscript with a cover letter to the editor not addressing the novelty is likely to be rejected without review.

More specifically, the Scope of the Journal includes:

Fundamental pyrolysis research on chemical substances and materials comprising:
- experimental studies of pyrolysis reactions such as chemical mechanism and kinetic investigations; this includes preparative pyrolysis methods for the synthesis of novel compounds and mechanisms of high temperature reactions;
- computational and theoretical studies of reaction mechanism, kinetics, and thermodynamics are acceptable, provided they are directly related to experimental data, either new or previously published, but they must be described adequately in the paper;
- computational processing of pyrolysis data, such as advanced pattern recognition and principal component analysis and other multivariate analyses.

Analytical pyrolysis, i.e. the characterization of a material in inert atmosphere by thermally induced degradation reactions;
- exploring chemical composition and structure of materials by revealing thermal and chemical decomposition reactions leading to products fully identified by chemical and spectroscopic methods;
- applications of analytical pyrolysis in environmental, biological, medical, forensic, cultural heritage, food, geochemical, polymer, and materials science;
- new instrumentation and new analytical methods using pyrolysis reactions or to unravel the chemical composition of pyrolysis products.

Applied pyrolysis dealing with the development of pyrolysis processes for producing valuable chemicals and/or energy carriers (gas, liquid, solid or electricity) and/or materials from fossil or renewable feedstock or waste, the recycling of materials, and the disposal of toxic substances. The manuscript must discuss the relationships between pyrolysis conditions and product characteristics. This topic includes:

- various feedstock (fossil fuels, biomass, wastes, polymers, etc.) and the co-processing of different feedstock;

- various thermal processes (slow and fast pyrolysis, torrefaction, carbonization, high pressure pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, deoxygenation, hydropyrolysis, solvent liquefaction).

The combination of a pyrolysis process with other types of treatment (mechanical, biological, or chemical) or materials characterization is within the scope of the journal only if the main focus of the manuscript is the pyrolysis process. Integrated processes combining pyrolysis reactors and products purification are welcome, if different pyrolysis conditions are studied. The computational modeling of pyrolysis reactors or processes should be related to experimental data, either new or previously published, but they must be described adequately in the paper.

The pyrolysis conditions should be described thoroughly (residence times of solid and vapors, temperature distributions, etc.). The pyrolysis products must be chemically characterized. Catalysts should be physically and chemically characterized before reaction, and, when feasible analysis of catalysts after reaction is also desirable. While this may not always be possible, at least qualitative assessments should be made.

The investigation of pyrolysis of a new feedstock or material with conventional methods, but without new development of the pyrolysis process is not sufficiently novel to be considered by JAAP.

Review articles are invited by the Editors but may also be proposed in writing to the Review Editor. The subject of review articles should be broad enough to appeal to a wide range of readers. Discussion should be concise, but adequate. More detailed discussion may be appropriate in some cases. It is expected that reviews should be critical rather than just catalogs of published data. They should include the most important, recent advances in the topic, whereas papers of low scientific significance should be given very limited coverage.

Out of the scope of JAAP

The Journal does not consider studies based on:

- the activation of carbons and characterization of activated carbons;

- thermal analysis, mass yields without characterization of the pyrolysis products by chemical and spectroscopic methods;

- characterization and application of pyrolysis products, unless clearly related to/aimed at understanding the influence/details of pyrolysis processes and conditions;

- theoretical studies, kinetic modelling etc. which are not complemented with or validated by experimental data

- combustion, gasification or incineration unless specifically related to the interplay between pyrolysis and oxidation reactions.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"Analytical Abstracts, BIOSIS Citation Index, Chemical Abstracts, Current Contents - Physical, Chemical & Earth Sciences, Chemical & Earth Sciences, Mass Spectrometry Bulletin, Science Citation Index, Scopus"}

It covers all aspects of the Biobased materials field with a highly interdisciplinary scope, from the cultivation, plantation, production, agronomy, and synthesis to processing, characterization, testing, influence of biobased materials and bioenergy on carbon-neutral, evaluation of the influence of climate and environment on biobased materials and bioenergy, etc.

Biobased materials refer to any materials which naturally exist and are not solely artificial synthetic. JBMBE promotes sustainable biomaterials produced from renewable biomass resources, which has becoming attractive and promising potential materials in various scientific and industrial applications.

Plants are the main biomass producers that form the most important raw materials for biobased materials. The largest share of these crops is used for the production of technical oils, industrial starch as well as bio-based plastics. Moreover, straw as a form of non-edible agricultural waste of a raw material, gradually has been applied in many places. Wood consists mainly of the carbohydrates cellulose, hemicellulose, which have long been used for fiber and paper production, as well as sugars, such as xylose. Microorganisms and enzymes are used in biobased material and bio-production development. Microorganisms are used in fermentation, production of biological substances, decomposition and degradation of macromolecular substances. Based on the development of microbial fermentation technology, the transformation of complex substances can be achieved in high yield at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Moreover, fungal biomass could be used for a variety of applications, including the creation of new bio-based materials.

In addition, the development of (bio)technology enable the reuse of waste products as secondary raw materials and cascaded use. Thus, previously unused organic residues and waste materials are increasingly coming into focus as valuable resources and promising starting points for materials. Recycling and cascade utilization of waste into secondary raw materials, that is, the use of raw materials over several product stages, has become an important part of a bio-based economy.

This has led to the emergence of new research domains dealing with the recognition by computers of the constituent elements of documents - including characters, symbols, text, lines, graphics, images, handwriting, signatures, etc. In addition, these new domains deal with automatic analyses of the overall physical and logical structures of documents, with the ultimate objective of a high-level understanding of their semantic content. We have also seen renewed interest in optical character recognition (OCR) and handwriting recognition during the last decade. Document analysis and recognition are obviously the next stage.

Automatic, intelligent processing of documents is at the intersections of many fields of research, especially of computer vision, image analysis, pattern recognition and artificial intelligence, as well as studies on reading, handwriting and linguistics. Although quality document related publications continue to appear in journals dedicated to these domains, the community will benefit from having this journal as a focal point for archival literature dedicated to document analysis and recognition.

This journal publishes articles of four primary types - original research papers, correspondence, overviews and summaries, and research notes. Special issues on active areas of research are encouraged. We welcome submissions in all areas related to document analysis and recognition.

New datasets to support document analysis research are generally of interest to the readership of IJDAR. Several conditions need to be satisfied first, however, before a paper presenting such a dataset will be considered for publication in the journal. (a) The dataset must be new, (b) The dataset must be freely available to the internationa l research community on a public repository, and (c) The dataset and its distribution must follow all applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data privacy and usage rights. In addition, a new dataset in-and-of-itself does not make a publishable paper. The paper must include, in addition, experimental results that illustrate and demonstrate the utility and significance of the new dataset.

JCI publishes papers on theoretical and applied causal research across the range of academic disciplines that use quantitative tools to study causality.

The past two decades have seen causal inference emerge as a unified field with a solid theoretical foundation, useful in many of the empirical and behavioral sciences. Journal of Causal Inference aims to provide a common venue for researchers working on causal inference in biostatistics and epidemiology, economics, political science and public policy, cognitive science and formal logic, and any field that aims to understand causality. The journal serves as a forum for this growing community to develop a shared language and study the commonalities and distinct strengths of their various disciplines' methods for causal analysis.

Existing discipline-specific journals tend to bury causal analysis in the language and methods of traditional statistical methodologies, creating the inaccurate impression that causal questions can be handled by routine methods of regression or simultaneous equations, glossing over the special precautions demanded by causal analysis. In contrast, JCI highlights both the uniqueness and interdisciplinary nature of causal research.

This includes optical, electronic, mechanical, and quantum mechanical aspects, as well as research on the underlying mathematical algorithms and computational details. The related areas of energy conversion/storage and of molecular and biological systems, in which the thrust is on the charge transport, electronic, mechanical, and optical properties, are also covered.


In particular, we encourage manuscripts dealing with device simulation; with optical and optoelectronic systems and photonics; with energy storage (e.g. batteries, fuel cells) and harvesting (e.g. photovoltaic), with simulation of circuits, VLSI layout, logic and architecture (based on, for example, CMOS devices, quantum-cellular automata, QBITs, or single-electron transistors); with electromagnetic simulations (such as microwave electronics and components); or with molecular and biological systems. However, in all these cases, the submitted manuscripts should explicitly address the electronic properties of the relevant systems, materials, or devices and/or present novel contributions to the physical models, computational strategies, or numerical algorithms. Specifically, manuscripts that present simulation results obtained using widely available and employed open-source software tools are only appropriate if they show how to augment computational-tool capabilities (i.e., algorithm/code development), if they present significant novel physical properties and applications of the systems studied that are not routinely accessed via such tools, or if multiple open-source or open-source/original codes are combined in a novel multiphysics/multiscale fashion. In addition, manuscripts that present simulation results obtained using commercially available TCAD tools (DFT packages, process, device or circuit simulation software, electromagnetic simulation software, and such) are generally not publishable as standalone theory papers in JCEL; we recommend that these papers be accompanied by experimental results and submitted to broader-scope journals in applied physics or engineering.

It develops mathematical and computational models and uses advanced computing techniques to simulate these models, driven by data. Its overarching goal is to understand and solve complex problems. It has reached a level of predictive and interventional capability that now firmly complements the traditional pillars of experimentation and theory.

The recent advances in experimental techniques have opened up new windows into physical and biological processes at many levels of detail. The resulting data explosion allows for detailed data-driven modeling and simulation which is no longer feasible using traditional analytical approaches alone.

This new discipline in science combines computational thinking, modern computational methods, devices and collateral technologies to address problems far beyond the scope of traditional numerical methods.

Computational science typically unifies three distinct elements:

 Modeling, Algorithms and Simulations (e.g. numerical and non-numerical, discrete and continuous);
 Software developed to solve science (e.g., biological, physical, and social), engineering, medicine, and humanities problems;
 Computer and information science that develops and optimizes the advanced system hardware, software, networking, and data management components (e.g. problem solving environments).

The Journal of Computational Science aims to be an international platform to exchange novel research results in simulation-based science across all scientific disciplines. It publishes advanced innovative, interdisciplinary research where complex multi-scale, multi-domain problems in science and engineering are solved, integrating sophisticated numerical methods, computation, data, networks, and novel devices.

The journal welcomes original, unpublished high quality contributions in the field of computational science at large, addressing one or more of the aforementioned elements.

Emerging areas in heat transfer, energy sustainability, and carbon neutrality are very welcome.
Papers may include theoretical modeling, experimental techniques, experimental data, and/or application of enhanced heat transfer technology.
The journal will also consider well-prepared review articles within the identified subject areas.
Archival quality papers previously published at limited distribution conferences are also accepted. The author may need to provide a copyright release from the conference publisher.
Manuscripts should discuss how they are both related to, and unique from, existing published works. It is not sufficient to merely analyze or test a slightly modified shape or range of operating parameters. If "shape" issues are involved, what is important about this shape? Is it important to specific applications? If so, discuss this. A key question is "What new results, or understanding, does the manuscript provide?" Additionally, CFD papers must address and discuss the "underlying physics" of their numerical study. It is insufficient to simply present a CFD solution without in-depth discussion of the transfer mechanisms involved. Papers that are not related to "enhanced heat and mass transfer" or "high performance" heat transfer concepts or systems will not be accepted for review.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"Web of Science"}

We welcome and encourage the submission of papers on robotics research covering:

Real-world applications: environment, construction, forestry, agriculture, mining, nuclear, subsea, intelligent highways, healthcare, search and rescue, military, and space (orbital and planetary).
Technical and scientific topics: sensing, sensors, mechanical design, computing architectures, communication, planning, learning, and control, human-robot interaction, robotic verification, validation and security.
The Journal encourages publication of work that has both theoretical and practical significance. Authors will be encouraged to implement their work and demonstrate its utility on significant problems with an emphasis on the underlying principles. That is, the Journal will encourage reporting on what was learned in doing the work, rather than merely on what was done. Also encouraged are comparative or meta-studies and verification of theoretical results as well as reports of extended field experiments that seek to validate autonomous systems in representative environments. Accepted paper submission categories include the research paper, review paper, research note (or short paper), field report, and invited paper.

The Journal will push the frontiers of electronic publishing in the following ways:

Exploitation of the medium via multimedia that accompany articles. JFR will publish code, models, data, and animations (either synthetic or actual video demonstrations) as appendices to articles. Such appendices will not be a requirement for publication but will be encouraged.
Low-cost access to articles and appendices. JFR will be deliberately structured so as to reduce the costs of publication. Fast and easy access to the journal will accelerate the pace at which new results can be absorbed by other researchers. It will also allow access to new results by a large population across the globe currently not privileged to the infrastructure required to support robotics research and, in some cases, who do not have easy access to archival quality printed journals.
Reduced time to publication. JFR will organize the reviewing and publication process in such a way that a short turnaround time is possible. Reviews will be led by members of the Editorial Board and by notable researchers. Papers and reviews will be managed via a Web interface and a paid managing editor will be in charge of ensuring the process of submission and resubmission runs smoothly. Before being asked to review a paper, reviewers will be asked whether they have the time to review the paper, and if they do not, they will not be sent the paper.
Free online access in the developing world. Free online access to this journal is available for developing world institutions through the Research4Life collective. For more information, visit www.research4life.org.

Even though the advantages of this technology for classes of applications have been acknowledged, research in a variety of disciplines, including not only multiple domains of computer science (networking, middleware, programming, algorithms) but also application disciplines themselves, as well as such areas as sociology and economics, is needed to broaden the applicability and scope of the current body of knowledge. Topics that fit within this theme include:

Protocols, middleware, and services for security, discovery, sharing, management etc., of computing, storage, data and other resources - within dynamic, distributed communities
Scaling issues in various dimensions: number of sites, number of users, number of resources, aggregate performance, and amount of data
Peer-to-peer and internet computing
Design environments, application development tools, languages and compilation techniques for GRID Computing
Grid applications and system solutions in science, engineering and commerce
Novel uses of Grid Computing concepts and technologies, for example in sensor nets and education
Advanced collaboration technologies for collaborative work, information sharing and problem solving
The implications of Grid technologies for emerging optical and wireless infrastructures

Tabu search (TS), scatter search (SS) and path reliniking (PR) have become the focus of numerous comparative studies and practical applications. Fruitful discoveries about preferred strategies for solving difficult optimization problems have surfaced as a result. Advanced TS, SS and PR methods exploit a collection of memory components that are referred to as adaptive memory programming (AMP). AMP procedures embody a framework that goes beyond simple mechanisms to incorporate intensification and diversification strategies. The AMP area welcomes submissions that describe innovative applications or the development of new methodology for the use of memory within heuristic search procedures.

 

Artificial Intelligence and Constraint Programming
This area covers heuristic search based on artificial intelligence techniques and their application to artificial intelligence planning, scheduling, design, constraint satisfaction, and game theory. It includes heuristics and metaheuristics for both systematic and local search in artificial intelligence. Of particular interest are heuristics based on constraint programming, a field that emerges from artificial intelligence and is an orthogonal and complementary approach to mathematical programming. This includes heuristics based on hybrid methods, e.g., those that combine local search and constraint programming or integrate constraint and mathematical programming.

 

Combinatorial Optimization
This area will act as an international forum for heuristic and metaheuristic research and development for combinatorial optimization problems. We welcome papers that present high quality, innovative and original research ideas and applications from across a wide spectrum of theoretical and applied research issues. Themes that are relevant to this area include (but are not limited to) graph theoretic problems and applications, sequencing and scheduling, engineering design, routing, cutting and packing, and set covering. In particular, we welcome inter-disciplinary approaches that attempt to work at the interface of relevant disciplines (such as Operational Research, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Engineering and Management).

Evolutionary Computation
This area welcomes manuscripts on all aspects of evolutionary computation. Submissions covering advances in the theory, practice, and application of all evolutionary techniques, either individually or collectively, are encouraged. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to evolutionary approaches to optimization and machine learning, evolution of emergent properties, characterization of problems suitable for evolutionary algorithms, implementation issues of evolutionary algorithms, parallel computation of evolutionary algorithms, and applications of evolutionary computation to various problems in science, engineering, and business. Manuscripts on hybrid procedures, combining existing heuristic techniques including methodologies from other areas of operation research and computer science, are of great interest. Also of great interest are implementations of robust artificial systems that use evolutionary computation as a key component of their architecture. In particular, manuscripts discussing methodological innovations that can by applied to a wide range of problems are strongly encourag ed. Additionally, survey papers describing state-of-the-art developments in a given field (including the perspective from evolutionary techniques) are welcomed.

Large-Scale Optimization and Decomposition Methods
This area seeks papers that apply heuristic search methods to large-scale optimization problems that might require different types of decomposition approaches. This includes problems found in practice that must be decomposed as a sequence of simpler problems as well as large instances that are decomposed into smaller parts that are subsequently optimized independently. Typical methodologies applied to problems in this area include Large Neighborhood Search and Matheuristics, i.e., hybrids of metaheuristics and mathematical programming techniques.

Logistics and Supply Chain
This area seeks papers that creatively apply heuristic search methods to important decision problems in logistics and supply chain problems. This includes problems from fields such as facility location, transportation and scheduling. Many decision problems in logistics and supply chain management may be formulated as optimization problems. Typically, these problems are too difficult to be solved exactly within a reasonable amount of time and heuristics become the methodology of choice. In cases where simply obtaining a feasible solution is not satisfactory, but where the quality of solution is critical, it becomes important to investigate efficient procedures to obtain the best possible solutions within time limits that are deemed practical. We seek well-written papers that span the full spectrum from theory to practice regarding heuristics and metaheuristics applications to logistics and supply chain problems. Papers may make a methodological contribution; contribute by developing and analyzing novel models motivated by current industrial problems and case studies. Contributions must be significant, relevant, and conceptually sound and must meet the rigorous standards of the journal.

Metaheuristic Methodologies
The Metaheuristics Methodologies area seeks to publish papers that espouse new general-purpose metaheuristics or provide analysis and comparison of existing methods. In both cases, the papers should provide a clear exposition of the relationship between the research reported in the manuscript and the extant body of research literature. The work can be either theoretical or empirical. If the work is empirical, it is important that sound scientific methods be employed. In particular, it is important the test data sets used in the work be made available to the research community. Additionally, concise statements of hypothesis must be provided along with the evidence that supports them. Both statistical and qualitative significance should be demonstrated.

Real-World Applications
This area welcomes manuscripts dealing with practical applications. Papers in this area can deal with new applications for which no previous solution methods exist or for which previous methods have proved unsatisfactory. Of particular interest are those papers that show how the application of heuristic methods has resulted in measurable benefits such as cost reduction or revenue increase.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"ABS Academic Journal Quality Guide, ACM Digital Library, ANVUR, BFI List, Baidu, CLOCKSS, CNKI, CNPIEC, Current Contents/Engineering, Computing and Technology, DBLP, Dimensions, EBSCO Applied Science & Technology Source, EBSCO Computer Science Index, EBSCO Computers & Applied Sciences Complete, EBSCO Discovery Service, EBSCO Engineering Source, EBSCO STM Source, ECONIS, EI Compendex, Google Scholar, INSPEC, Japanese Science and Technology Agency (JST), Journal Citation Reports/Science Edition, Naver, OCLC WorldCat Discovery Service, Portico, ProQuest ABI/INFORM, ProQuest Advanced Technologies & Aerospace Database, ProQuest-ExLibris Primo, ProQuest-ExLibris Summon, Research Papers in Economics (RePEc), SCImago, SCOPUS, Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), TD Net Discovery Service, UGC-CARE List (India), Wanfang"}

The journal aims to publish full research papers of original, significant and rigorous work and so to contribute to increased production efficiency and improved component performance.

Areas of interest to the journal include:
 Casting, forming and machining
 Additive processing and joining technologies
 The evolution of material properties under the specific conditions met in manufacturing processes
 Surface engineering when it relates specifically to a manufacturing process
 Design and behavior of equipment and tools

The core interest of the journal is the processing of metals, but we also cover other materials, where the article is focused on the influence of the process on the materials, and where there are not other more appropriate dedicated journals. For example ductile forming of polymers if of interest, but the influence of polymer composition on properties is well covered in dedicated polymer journals.

A typical article will examine the influence of process design, tool design, or process operating conditions on the properties of the material or the future performance of the equipment. Most articles combine appropriate quantitative analysis with well designed experiments. The sciences of materials, tribology and thermodynamics are well covered in other dedicated journals, so these topics are of interest to this journal only when applied specifically to give insight into the processing techniques used in manufacturing components. For example, processes for engineering surfaces are of interest, but the analysis of friction is well covered by specialised journals of wear or tribology.

The journal's Editorial Policy defines our basis for considering submissions. Typical published articles will contribute significant new transferable knowledge in the form of (a) an innovation or (b) a new insight into material processing in the form of a transferable qualitative or quantitative explanation of a difference between experimental measurements and the predictions of existing theory. 'Transferable' knowledge applies to materials or processing conditions broader than those tested within the article.

The Journal of Materials Processing Technology generally does not accept papers in the following areas:
 Simulation with no experimental verification and/or which gives no new insight into the process
 Experimental reports which do not provide a convincing analytical or physical explanation of observed behaviour
 Topics that properly belong to the materials science literature. Examples include the synthesis of materials, chemical experiments and studies of material composition.
 The analysis of material properties, surfaces or product performance without reference to the processing which caused them.
 Statistical methods or techniques from Artificial Intelligence which treat the process as a black box.
 The operation of equipment, without reference to materials (such as tool path design in CNC machining), or the management of factory systems.

As stated in the journal's editorial policy, the Journal of Materials Processing Technology does not accept multiple-part papers, short communications or case studies.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"Applied Mechanics Reviews, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, Current Contents, INSPEC, Science Citation Index Expanded, Web of Science, Ei Compendex, Scopus"}

Such systems involve constraints placed not only on their size, cost, and power consumption, but also on the timeliness of the image data processed.

Examples of such systems are mobile phones, digital still/video/cell-phone cameras, portable media players, personal digital assistants, high-definition television, video surveillance systems, industrial visual inspection systems, medical imaging devices, vision-guided autonomous robots, spectral imaging systems, and many other real-time embedded systems. In these real-time systems, strict timing requirements demand that results are available within a certain interval of time as imposed by the application.

It is often the case that an image processing algorithm is developed and proven theoretically sound, presumably with a specific application in mind, but its practical applications and the detailed steps, methodology, and trade-off analysis required to achieve its real-time performance are not fully explored, leaving these critical and usually non-trivial issues for those wishing to employ the algorithm in a real-time system.

The Journal of Real-Time Image Processing is intended to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of image processing, serving the greater community of researchers, practicing engineers, and industrial professionals who deal with designing, implementing or utilizing image processing systems which must satisfy real-time design constraints.

The journal solicits original contributions in the following areas:

Real-time image and video processing algorithms
Real-time embedded image/video processing systems
Real-time image and video processing hardwa re and architecture including FPGA, DSP, GPU, GPP, ASIC, System-on-Chip (SoC), and System-in-a-Package (SiP) implementations
Real-time software optimizations and related design paradigms for image/video processing
Real-time hardware/software co-design for image and video processing
Real-time image and video processing applications including digital, cell-phone, and smart cameras, machine vision, industrial inspection, surveillance and security, image and video compression for transmission and for database storage and retrieval, biomedical imaging, spectral imaging, etc.

Vision Statement
Journal of Semiconductor Technology and Science is published to provide a forum for R&D people involved in wider scope of the integrated circuit technology, i.e., VLSI fabrication process technology, device technology, circuit design, packaging, test and other novel applications of this ever scaling technology. When IC was invented, these people worked together in one place, and understood every details of the flow from bare silicon to package testing. However, as the IC evolves with Moores curve, in-depth knowledge content has exploded, and our individual expertise has to become narrowed down. As a result, different branches in the technical society were created, and have made it more difficult to communicate as a whole. The fisherman, however, always knows that he can capture more fish at the border where warm and cold-water meet. Thus, we decided to break the knowledge barrier, by providing communication channel for people working in relevant VLSI technology in common subject Device & Design Integration. Treaties on core technology that will affect the device including CMOS and MEMS devices, from the substrate to gate fabrication and its characterization and analysis are our major focus. The other focus is how to make the device function in a system and its verification the design. This device & design forum should provide better use of the other information and enhance the overall VLSI technology, eventually serving better to create more efficient devices and systems.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"SCIE(Science Citation Index Expanded), SCOPUS"}

The scope encompasses both for-profit and non-profit operations. Whatever the topic and context, operations must be at the heart of the research question, not just in the context. For example, work on charismatic leadership at a manufacturing plant is within the scope only if the research question links clearly to the management of operations (the vast majority of work on charismatic leadership does not); the fact that the empirical context is manufacturing does not constitute a sufficient condition. Papers published in JOM must be about operations management, and they have to link to authentic practical operational questions and challenges. This does not mean all work must be motivated by practical considerations, it means the link to practice must be credible, and something that is considered at the outset of the research endeavor, not merely as an implication. Authors cannot simply assume or declare that knowledge produced strictly for academic purposes can be "translated" or "implemented" to make it practically relevant.

We encourage primarily empirical research that is grounded in relevant operations management problems. Non-empirical work is not categorically excluded, but because demonstrating both academic and practical relevance is difficult in typical conceptual work (e.g., literature reviews, theory development), we invite prospective authors to focus on empirical submissions. We also welcome empirically-grounded analytic models, the guidelines for which can be found here.

We promote no specific methodology or epistemology. We encourage diversity both in terms of theoretical bases and empirical approaches. On methodological matters, the key considerations are rigor and fit: Is the work methodologically transparent? Do the claims plausibly follow from the premises? Is there a fit between the research question and the methodology used? All these questions are agnostic to the kind of methodology used or the epistemological foundation embraced. Finally, while some of JOM's departments may be more suitable to interdisciplinary work, it makes no sense to discourage paradigmatically more focused, unidisciplinary work, if it provides good fit with the research question.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"Engineering Information, Inc, Executive Sciences Institute, INSPEC, International Abstracts in Operations Research, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, SciSearch/Science Citation Index, CompuMath Citation Index, Current Contents/Engineering, Computing & Technology, Information Access Company, Social Sciences Citation Index"}

The primary objective of JQT since its founding in 1969 is to provide the quality professional with innovative methodological tools to solve problems related to quality. The quality of a process or product relates to the capability of satisfying expressed and unexpressed customer needs. The technology that generates process and product data as well as the technology related to analytical methods that support quality improvement are evolving at a rapid pace. Technological advances provide many opportunities for innovative solutions. Thus, the main mission of the papers in JQT is to provide these innovative methodologies to the quality community. JQT publishes the following types of papers.
Regular Research: Regular research papers develop, evaluate, and present innovative analytical solutions to real industry, government, and societal challenges in support of product and process quality. Expository, review, and tutorial papers written with the goal of advancing methodological practice in quality technology are also acceptable.
Case Study: Case Study papers illustrate a complex problem, use real data, and demonstrate the innovative application of methodologies to solve or bring new insight towards a solution related to quality.
Software: Software Papers present a detailed description of a new computer code package that supports quality improvement. Survey papers that present a critical review of existing software related to quality improvement will also be considered.
JQT encourages authors to demonstrate the usefulness of their research by applying their methods to real data and encourages sharing of code to support reproducibility. When appropriate, JQT will consider publishing Letters to the Editor. Letters to the Editor provide an opportunity for commentary on recently published works. Letters that refer to papers published in the four most recent issues will be subjected to the regular review process. Authors of the original paper will be given the opportunity to review and comment submitted letters. For more details on each type of paper, please read the Instructions for Authors. JQT does not publish research related to quality management.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"American Statistical Association, De Gruyter Saur, EBSCOhost, Compendex, Scopus, Gale, INIS Collection Search, OCLC, ProQuest, Web of Science, NCB Abstracts and Current Contents, World Ceramics Abstracts"}

It was published under various titles and forms since 1904, with its roots as Scientific Papers issued as the Bulletin of the Bureau of Standards.

In announcing the first volume of the Bulletin of the Bureau of Standards, S.W. Stratton (first Director of the Bureau) wrote:

"The Bulletin of the Bureau of Standards, of which this is the initial number, will embody the results of its investigations, researches, and other work which may be of importance to the scientific, technical, and manufacturing interests of the country."

In 1928, the Scientific Papers were combined with Technologic Papers, which reported results of investigations of material and methods of testing. This new publication was titled the Bureau of Standards Journal of Research. Beginning in 1959, the Journal was published in four separate sections, A, B, C, and D. Section A covered physical and chemical research, Section B covered studies in mathematics and mathematical physics, Section C covered engineering and instrumentation, and Section D covered research in radio propagation, communications, and atmospheric physics. In 1977 Sections A and B were combined and published as the Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards.1 After the National Bureau of Standards became the National Institute of Standards and Technology on August 23, 1988, the journal was renamed the Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. In 2012, Journal of Research of NIST moved to an electronic-only, rapid publication model.

The Journal of Research of NIST served as a major mechanism for NIST scientists to report on their research in metrology and related fields of physical science.

The Journal of Research of NIST remains an open access publication and all papers published within it are available for free.

"Sol-gel" processing is one of the most efficient means of tailoring such properties, and opens the way for the development and production of novel high-technology materials.

 

The primary objective of the Journal of Sol-Gel Science and Technology (JSST), the official journal of the International Sol-Gel Society (ISGS - http://www.isgs.org/), is to provide an international forum for the dissemination of scientific, technological, and general knowledge about materials processed by chemical nanotechnologies known as the "sol-gel" process. The materials of interest include gels, gel-derived glasses, ceramics in form of nano- and micro-powders, bulk, fibres, thin films and coatings as well as more recent materials such as hybrid organic-inorganic materials and composites. Such materials exhibit a wide range of optical, electronic, magnetic, chemical, environmental, and biomedical properties and functionalities. Methods for producing sol-gel-derived materials and the industrial uses of these materials are also of great interest.       

 

JSST publishes original, not previously published, research and technological manuscripts in the form of extended reports. Occasionally, invited papers on scientific and technologically important issues in emerging fields of sol-gel materials are published as special issues. A Sol-Gel Product News section is also available for publication of short papers on products developed via chemical technology.

It is now part of JSV editorial policy not to consider submissions that predict the dynamics of nano-systems based on the continuum theories unless a comparison is included with either molecular simulations or experiments

** Category I  Guidance Notes:
It is now part of formalised JSV editorial policy not to publish papers whose original contribution is solely in the mathematical treatment of a system of ODEs of motion, unless the method of solution is demonstrable shown (a) to be novel and superior to existing methods or (b) to be applicable to significant physical problems in such a way that it clearly and unambiguously engenders new insights

*** Category M  Guidance Notes:

In all cases submissions should address the physics of the phenomena through appropriately advanced theoretical approaches or by experimental investigations. Submissions based on experimental work should give new insight into the physics of the system dynamics, for example by including comparison with predictions from models or numerical simulations

Also, authors are encouraged to explicitly reference Open Science material in their manuscript (e.g., via a DOI from the open repository). If authors are not able to disclose any material (for example, industrial data subject to non-disclosure agreements), we encourage authors to explicitly acknowledge this by including a short statement in their manuscript. Depending on the type of research presented in a manuscript, Open Science material could include study protocols, (anonymized) raw or analyzed data, data analysis scripts, source code, customized tools and infrastructures, experimental material, codebooks, etc. If authors agree to participate in the JSS Open Science Initiative, after the acceptance of a manuscript, they will be invited to submit a link to Open Science material for review by the JSS Open Science Board. After a successful review (which does not impact the acceptance of the manuscript) considering availability and usability of the material, the publisher will add a statement to the final version of the manuscript acknowledging that the Open Science package was validated by the JSS Open Science Board.

In addition to regular papers, JSS features two special tracks (In Practice, New Ideas and Trends Papers), as well as special issues.

In Practice is exclusively focused on work that increases knowledge transfer from industry to research. It accepts: (1) Applied Research Reports where we invite submissions that report results (positive or negative) concerning the experience of applying/evaluating systems and software technologies (methods, techniques and tools) in real industrial settings. These comprise empirical studies conducted in industry (e.g., action research, case studies) or experience reports that may help understanding situations in which technologies really work and their impact. Submissions should include information on the industrial setting, provide motivation, explain the events leading to the outcomes, including the challenges faced, summarize the outcomes, and conclude with lessons learned, take-away messages, and practical advice based on the described experience. Contributing authors from industry are encouraged but not mandatory. (2) Practitioner Insights where we invite experience reports showing what actually happens in practical settings, illustrating the challenges (and pain) that practitioners face, and presenting lessons learned. Problem descriptions with significant details on the context, underlying causes and symptoms, and technical and organizational impact are also welcome. Practitioner insights papers may also comprise invited opinionated views on the evolution of chosen topic areas in practice. In contrast to applied research reports, practitioner insights are limited to four pages and the first author must be from industry. Finally, submissions to this track should be within scope of the journal's above topics of interest and they will be evaluated through industry-appropriate criteria for their merit in reporting useful industrial experience rather than in terms of academic novelty of research results.

New Ideas and Trends Papers
New ideas, especially those related to new research trends, emerge quickly. To accommodate timely dissemination thereof, JSS introduces the New Ideas and Trends Paper (NITP). NITPs should focus on the systems/software engineering aspects of new emerging areas, including: the internet of things, big data, cloud computing, software ecosystems, cyber-physical systems, green/sustainable systems, continuous software engineering, crowdsourcing, and the like. We distinguish two types of NITPs:

A short paper that discusses a single contribution to a specific new trend or a new idea.
A long paper that provides a survey of a specific trend, as well as a (possibly speculative) outline of a solution.
NITPs are not required to be fully validated, but preliminary results that endorse the merit of the proposed ideas are welcomed.
We anticipate revisiting specific new trends periodically, for instance through reflection or progress reports.
New Ideas and Trend Papers warrant speedy publication.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"Academic Journal Guide (Chartered Association of Business Schools), Science Citation Index Expanded, Current Contents - Engineering, Computing & Technology, Research Alert, Web of Science, ABI/Inform, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, Computer Literature Index, Computer Reviews, Engineering Index, Current Contents, Computer Abstracts, CAD/CAM Abstracts, INSPEC, Scopus"}

Research Areas
Computational Biology
Computational Biology has experienced exceptional growth in the past years. Computational Biology is an interdisciplinary field that aims at generating new biological insights from genomic, proteomic and other novel molecular data with current-day and innovative informatics methods. The field has spawned specially targeted journals and results are also being published in journals targeted towards the biological sciences. By inviting submissions from Computational Biology, the Journal of the ACM manifests its commitment to interdisciplinary aspects of informatics.

Computational Biology offers fundamental challenges to the analysis of biological data for instance: New methods of pattern recognition, modeling and simulation have to be developed and applied in order to elicit biologically relevant signals in generally noisy biological data. Approaches to systematic validation of the methods have to be brought forward in the face of incomplete understanding such fundamental concepts to biology as evolution or free energy. Since cost functions in computational biology are inherently inaccurate, confidence estimates are very helpful if computer predictions are to be interpreted. The development of the definition and algorithmic solution of a problem tend to go hand in hand, rather than the algorithm development following the definition of the problem. Protein function is a good example for a central term in the field that is developing as the field progresses. Information integration is a central issue since biological signals are often weak and can only be separated from background noise by using many different data sources.

JACM invites Computational Biology papers, especially those that address methodical issues like the ones mentioned above. Submissions should contain a clear and concise description of the biological background and the goal to be achieved, a definition of the problem statement, a presentation of an original contribution to insight into or a solution of the problem, and the description of a validation on artificial and/or biological data. It has to be argued especially if a paper does not contain substantial validation on biological data. Finally, the relevance of the contribution has to be argued in terms of other related work in the literature spanning the fields of computer science, computational biology and biology.

Submissions may be reviewed by computer scientists, computational biologists and biologists.
 
Economics and Computation
JACM seeks papers that make fundamental advances of broad interest at the interface of economics and computation. Specific topics include but are not limited to: computational social choice; design of auctions, markets, and mechanisms; economics of e-commerce, the Internet and social networks; equilibrium computation; learning in games and markets; prediction markets; and the price of anarchy.
 
Networking
JACM welcomes papers on the topic of Networking, particularly ones that focus on the fundamentals of networking. Typical papers of interest include ones that (1) unify a class of networking techniques, such as flow control mechanisms, routing mechanisms, multicast protocols; (2) demonstrate how an analytical technique or modeling tool can be applied to a class of networking problems; (3) expose a common principle that has been used to solve several networking problems; or (4) propose unifying theories of networking.
 
Programming Languages
JACM seeks papers that contribute to the scientific study of the design, semantics, implementation, and application of programming languages. Specific topics include: (1) compilation, including parsing, type checking, optimization, code generation, and run-time organization; (2) program analysis, including flow analysis, abstract interpretation, and type inference; (3) programming language concepts such as functional programming, object-oriented programming, modularity, data abstraction, concurrency, and parallelism; (4) foundational formalisms such as lambda-calculus, type theory, and process calculus; (5) semantics of programming languages, including axiomatic, operational, and denotational methods; (6) and domain theory and category theory as applied to programming languages.

Papers that may be suitable for submission as either Programming Languages, Software Engineering, or Logic in Computer Science will be handled through close coordination with the area editors. Papers should be submitted to only one area editor.
 
Software Engineering
JACM seeks papers that aim to establish a scientific basis for the design and development of large, complex software systems. Papers on all aspects of software engineering are welcome, including those that address: (1) all phases of system development: requirements elicitation, specification, design, prototyping, analysis, testing, debugging, verification, maintenance, and reverse engineering; (2) languages, techniques, and tools used during these phases; (3) and functional and non-functional properties of systems, e.g., correctness, performance, fault-tolerance, reliability, resource usage, safety-critical, security, time-critical, and usability.

Authors should use one or more traditional scientific methods, ranging from proof to experimentation, to demonstrate the soundness of their results. They should also provide evidence that their ideas scale. Submitted papers should be of interest to the entire Computer Science community.

Papers that could be submitted to either Programming Languages or Software Engineering will be handled through close coordination between both area editors.

Solids are interpreted broadly to include both hard and soft materials as well as natural and synthetic structures. The approach can be theoretical, experimental or computational.This research activity sits within engineering science and the allied areas of applied mathematics, materials science, bio-mechanics, applied physics, and geophysics.

The Journal was founded in 1952 by Rodney Hill, who was its Editor-in-Chief until 1968. The topics of interest to the Journal evolve with developments in the subject but its basic ethos remains the same: to publish research of the highest quality relating to the mechanics of solids. Thus, emphasis is placed on the development of fundamental concepts of mechanics and novel applications of these concepts based on theoretical, experimental or computational approaches, drawing upon the various branches of engineering science and the allied areas within applied mathematics, materials science, structural engineering, applied physics, and geophysics.

The main purpose of the Journal is to foster scientific understanding of the processes of deformation and mechanical failure of all solid materials, both technological and natural, and the connections between these processes and their underlying physical mechanisms. In this sense, the content of the Journal should reflect the current state of the discipline in analysis, experimental observation, and numerical simulation.

Scope

Water process engineering is interpreted by us as the understanding and application of the fundamental laws and principles of nature that allow us to transform raw or waste water sources into products that are useful to society, while operating at laboratory, pilot or full industrial scale. These products include clean water, energy and material resources. Our scope focuses on the design, operation, control, modelling, optimization and intensification of chemical, physical, and biological processes for water treatment.

We emphasize the process engineering aspects of water treatment processes, for which the focus of the study is on the engineered application and practice rather than the fundamental and underlying science.

Submission of outstanding research articles and state-of-the-art reviews are actively encouraged from academic and industrial researchers and technologists in the following areas of interest:

Sustainable water treatment.
Potable and wastewater treatment, resource recovery and water reuse.
Community-based water treatment.
Membrane-based water and wastewater processing, such as forward osmosis processes (but excluding desalination i.e. water desalting).
Biological wastewater processing (aerobic and anaerobic) and biofilm reactors.
Nanotechnology-based water processing.
Industrial effluent processing and resource recovery/recycle.
Advanced oxidation processing.
Electro-based water processing.
Coagulation, precipitation and flocculation processes.
Fixed-bed adsorption processes.
Renewable energy powered water processing.
Development and application of novel materials for water processing.
We are particularly interested in the growth of submissions which emphasize the process engineering aspects of water sustainability, focusing on issues related to the reclamation, reuse and recycling of water, materials and energy from alternative sources, including fit-for-purpose treatment processes and technologies with reduced energy and chemical consumption, lower environmental/carbon footprint, and greater social benefit.

We are also interested in those submissions which explore emerging areas of research focus; please look out for our 'calls for papers' to be published in special issues. If you are interested in submitting a critical and insightful review paper on the state-of-the-art in a relevant area, we encourage you to contact one of the Editors-in-Chief first to discuss your proposal.

Please that, due to space limitations, we are unable to accept submissions which involve fundamental batch studies without a focus on engineering application. Common examples of this would include; studies of batch/static adsorption of model contaminants on adsorbents without dynamic flow studies, batch studies of photo-catalysts modified to operate in visible light for model contaminant degradation, microbiological studies without a strong link to biological processing, membrane fabrication without an application study.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"Science Citation Index Expanded, Scopus, INSPEC"}

The spirit of the journal comes from Norbert Wiener's understanding of cybernetics as "The Human Use of Human Beings." Hence, Kybernetes strives for conceptualization, examination and analysis through a systemic frame of reference, this applied to important issues of ecosystems, society, organizations, businesses and human behaviour.

Kybernetes is devoted to improvement in the understanding of human, social, organizational, technological and sustainable aspects of society and their interdependencies. It encourages consideration of a range of theories, methodologies and approaches, and their transdisciplinary links. Within the framework of Cybernetics and Systems Thinking, the journal welcomes topics from all domains of human, social, and ecological sciences, including contributing to themes of sustainability, viability, and the impact of technology on human beings and society.  

This multidisciplinary perspective includes a wide range of research fields such as:

sociology
management
psychology
economics
engineering
knowledge management
sustainability
operational systems
information systems
marketing
financial systems
the impact of Artificial Intelligence on society and business.
While covering this wide range of topics the journal is interested in publishing high-quality papers that show strong implications for social, economic and organizational systems. These may involve not only considerations involving philosophical, theoretical and methodologically oriented approaches, but also in-depth discussions of applications, implications and implementations.

The primary focus of the journal is on the methodological framework shared by mechanical scientists when dealing with theoretical or applied problems. Further, attention is paid to those phenomenological aspects which are characteristic for the mechanical problem at hand.

Papers submitted to Meccanica should be original and should adequately pay attention to the various aspects of mechanical and mathematical modelling, of solution, as well as of analysis of system behaviour.

The journal addresses:
fundamental and applications issues both in established areas of mechanics research as well as in emerging fields.
contemporary research pertaining to areas such as general mechanics, solid and structural mechanics, fluid mechanics, and mechanics of machines.
interdisciplinary fields at the border between different areas of mechanics, or between mechanics and other mathematical and engineering sciences, such as fluid-solid interaction; acoustic-structural coupling; thermomechanics; interaction of mechanics with dynamical systems, with advanced materials, with control, and with computation; electromechanics; biomechanics.

From an algorithmic point of view, memes have come to be regarded as building-blocks of prior knowledge, expressed in arbitrary computational representations (e.g., local search heuristics, fuzzy rules, neural models, etc.), that have been acquired through experience by a human or machine, and can be imitated (i.e., reused) across problems.

The Memetic Computing journal welcomes papers incorporating the aforementioned socio-cultural notion of memes into artificial systems, with particular emphasis on enhancing the efficacy of computational and artificial intelligence techniques for search, optimization, and machine learning through explicit prior knowledge incorporation. The goal of the journal is to thus be an outlet for high quality theoretical and applied research on hybrid, knowledge-driven computational approaches that may be characterized under any of the following categories of memetics:

Type 1: General-purpose algorithms integrated with human-crafted heuristics that capture some form of prior domain knowledge; e.g., traditional memetic algorithms hybridizing evolutionary global search with a problem-specific local search. The journal welcomes investigations into various modes of meme transmission. Demonstrations of memetics in the context of deep neuroevolution, synergizing evolutionary search of neural architectures with lifetime learning of specific tasks or sets of tasks, are of significant interest.
Type 2: Algorithms with the ability to automatically select, adapt, and reuse the most appropriate heuristics from a diverse pool of available choices; e.g., learning a mapping between global search operators and multiple local search schemes, given an optimization problem at hand.
Type 3: Algorithms that autonomously learn with experience, adaptively reusing data and/or machine learning models drawn from related problems as prior knowledge in new target tasks of interest; examples include, but are not limited to, transfer learning and optimization, multi-task learning and optimization, or any other multi-X evolutionary l earning and optimization methodologies.
Potential authors are encouraged to submit original research articles, including reviews and short communications, expanding the conceptual scope of memetics (e.g., to Type-X and beyond) and/or advancing the algorithmic state-of-the-art. Articles reporting novel real-world applications of memetics in areas including, but not limited to, multi-X evolutionary computation, neuroevolution, embodied cognition and intelligence of autonomous agents, continuous and discrete optimization, knowledge-guided machine learning, computationally expensive search problems, shall be considered for publication.

Department Editors: Melvyn Sim, National University of Singapore, and Huseyin Topaloglu, Cornell University
Combined power of algorithms, data and computation has enabled analytics to be indispensable for solving challenging problems in operations such as, among others, the sharing economy, online markets, public policy, healthcare, transportation logistics, and supply chains. Accordingly, the Department seeks papers that use mathematical modeling and analysis to drive decision-making in data-rich environments. We are particularly interested in papers that have strong methodological contributions with a clear path to making an impact in the practice of data-driven decision-making.

Our understanding of analytics, in terms of both methodology and application areas, is broad. We welcome papers with focus on optimization, stochastic analysis, and data-intensive methods. Application areas of interest range from business applications in online platforms, retail and operations to societal applications in healthcare and politics. The department looks for papers that excel in both their methodological contributions and their ability to incorporate large-scale data into the decision-making process, as opposed to papers that purely use standard tools to test hypotheses on the data. We value demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology on real-world data, but do not put it forth as a requirement for all papers submitted to the department. Nevertheless, the submitted work should have a clear path to contributing to the science of data-driven decision-making. While management insight is appreciated, we understand that a novel algorithmic approach may not immediately translate into management insight.

Environment, Health and Society
Department Editors: Ozlem Ergun, Northeastern University, Beril Toktay, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Anita Tucker, Boston University
We are interested in publishing innovative and impactful papers that contribute to improving health, environmental and societal outcomes by informing practices in business, government or non-governmental organizations. We look for papers that can provide insights that managers and policy makers need to address key challenges in a fast-changing and interconnected world. Of particular interest is work relevant to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, including but not limited to health, health equity, food safety and security, clean energy, climate action, responsible consumption and production, decent work, education and gender equality. We are also interested in work that expands the traditional boundaries of operations management by considering the societal externalities and equity implications of technology and operations management practices. We are open to a variety of approaches, including but not limited to algorithmic, behavioral, empirical, experimental, and modeling studies.

Manufacturing and Supply Chain Management
Department Editors: Wedad Elmaghraby, University of Maryland, and Mahesh Nagarajan, University of British Columbia
The Manufacturing and Supply Chain department aims to publish the best research in established and emerging areas of operations management. The core values of the department include intellectual depth, innovative thinking and value to applications. The department welcomes papers with rigorous and innovative analysis and papers with the potential for translatable actions and impact in practice. We aim to promote interdisciplinary research that is consistent with our core values.

We welcome papers that use a wide variety of methodologies, both descriptive as well as prescriptive in nature including but not limited to optimization, applied probability, game theory, econometrics, algorithm design, behavioral and decision science and simulation. We encourage work in emerging areas of operations that have historically been understudied and are of increased importance in todays global economy.

Operational Innovation
Department Editors: Francis de Vericourt, ESMT Berlin, and Kamalini Ramdas, London Business School
We take a broad view of innovation as being about new ways of creating social and economic value. We are in particularly interested in publishing research that examines directions in which operational thinking and decision-making can unleash value through more transformational (as opposed to incremental) innovation. This includes research on:

New processes for knowledge discovery and dissemination
New processes to develop and manage AI and ML for real problem solving
New business models for products and services
New ways of managing innovation to spur transformational value creation
We are open to all methodologies. We welcome analytical and empirical methods (including experiments). We are particularly focused on research that is both rigorous and has direct practical implications.

Services, Platforms and Revenue Management
Department Editors: Mor Armony, NYU Stern School of Business, Marcelo Olivares, University of Chile, and Guillaume Roels, INSEAD
The Department of Services, Platforms, and Revenue Management seeks manuscripts that offer enduring knowledge to improve our understanding of the design, performance, and their key drivers of service systems, platform management, and revenue management. The services or platforms of interest could involve interactions among businesses and/or consumers, or be internal to an organization.

We value novel research questions, impactful contributions, and rigorous execution. A strong motivation derived from real world applications is necessary, along with a clear contribution to knowledge and/or a demonstration of managerial relevance. We embrace a variety of methods, including analytical modeling, empirical methods, lab and field experiments, and numerical methods (simulation, machine learning). Given the cross-functional nature of services, we are very much open to interdisciplinary contributions that use or integrate methods and/or knowledge from different fields (e.g., social sciences and engineering).

Industries of interest could range from physical to information-based services, the decisions could range from strategic to operational, and the scope of analysis could range from macroscopic (e.g., industries, organizations) to meso and microscopic (e.g., teams, individuals). Topics include: wait time and capacity management, pricing and revenue management, service contracting, digital platform management and scaling, marketplaces, e- and m-commerce, process design and digitalization, service quality management, servicization and productization, access and location, network management, customer/employee experience management, people operations and organizational design, service design and innovation, peer-to-peer services, crowdsourcing, service globalization, sustainable and/or ethical issues in services.

Relative to the other departments for which there is potential overlap (e.g., healthcare, analytics, innovation), we value contributions that are more practice-driven than methodological and that are generalizable beyond a single domain of application.

To be publishable in the journal, articles must meet the highest scientific quality standards, contain significant and original new science, and make substantial advances in nanoscale science and technology. Research on the synthesis of materials should contain a significant innovation either in methodology, materials or demonstrated application.

Articles can be rejected without refereeing after this initial assessment by the editors. Due to the high volume of papers that we receive, we regret that we are unable to provide feedback on individual articles. Authors appealing against the decision will have to demonstrate to the Editorial Board of the journal at nano@ioppublishing.org that their paper contains significant new science of high quality and interest.

When complex phenomena going on in nature are viewed as computational processes, our understanding of these phenomena and of the essence of computation is enhanced. In this way one gains valuable insights into both natural sciences and computer science. Characteristic for man-designed computing inspired by nature is the metaphorical use of concepts, principles and mechanisms underlying natural systems. This type of computing includes evolutionary algorithms, neural networks, molecular computing and quantum computing.

The aim of the journal is (1) to provide a publication forum for, and to foster links and mutual understanding between researchers from various areas of natural computing, (2) to give researchers in natural sciences and computer science an insight into research trends in natural computing. The research in natural computing is concerned with theory, experiments, and applications, and the journal reports on each of these research lines. Moreover, the journal will cover natural computing in a very broad scope. Thus, e.g., the subarea of evolutionary algorithms will cover also very active research on the boundary of biology and computer science which views the evolution as a computational process, and the subarea of neural networks will also cover computational trends in brain research.

The journal is soliciting papers on all aspects of natural computing. Because of the interdisciplinary character of the journal a special effort will be made to solicit survey, review, and tutorial papers which would make research trends in a given subarea more accessible to the broad audience of the journal.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"ACM Digital Library, ANVUR, BFI List, BIOSIS, Baidu, Biological Abstracts, CLOCKSS, CNKI, CNPIEC, Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), Current Contents/Engineering, Computing and Technology, DBLP, Dimensions, EBSCO Academic Search, EBSCO Applied Science & Technology Source, EBSCO Biomedical Reference Collection, EBSCO Business Source, EBSCO Computer Science Index, EBSCO Computers & Applied Sciences Complete, EBSCO Discovery Service, EBSCO Engineering Source, EBSCO STM Source, EBSCO Science & Technology Collection, EI Compendex, EMBASE, EMBiology, Google Scholar, INSPEC, Japanese Science and Technology Agency (JST), Journal Citation Reports/Science Edition, Mathematical Reviews, Naver, Norwegian Register for Scientific Journals and Series, OCLC WorldCat Discovery Service, Portico, ProQuest Advanced Technologies & Aerospace Database, ProQuest-ExLibris Primo, ProQuest-ExLibris Summon, Reaxys, SCImago, SCOPUS, Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), TD Net Discovery Service, UGC-CARE List (India), WTI AG, Wanfang, zbMATH"}

As these conditions interact and change, the impact on human communities increases in size, scale, and scope. Such interactions necessarily need to be analyzed from an interdisciplinary perspective that includes both social and technical measures. For decision makers, the risk presents the challenge of managing known hazards, but unknown consequences in time of occurrence, scale of impact, and level of disruption in actual communities with limited resources. The journal is dedicated to bringing together the physical, social, and behavioral sciences; engineering; and the regulatory and policy environments to provide a forum for cutting edge, holistic, and cross-disciplinary approaches to anticipating risk, loss, and cost reduction from natural hazards. The journal welcomes rigorous research on the intersection between social and technical systems that advances concepts of resilience within lifeline and infrastructure systems and the organizations that manage them for all hazards. It offers a professional forum for researchers and practitioners working together to publish the results of truly interdisciplinary and partnered approaches to the anticipation of risk, loss reduction, and community resilience. Engineering topics covered include the characterization of hazard forces and the planning, design, construction, maintenance, performance, and use of structures in the physical environment. Social and behavioral sciences topics include analysis of the impact of hazards on communities and the organizations that seek to mitigate and manage response to hazards. These analyses suggest implications for improving policy performance in disaster environments and mitigation of recurring risks, as well as significant issues related to the built environment such as land use, building standards, and the role of financial markets and insurance. Physical science topics include investigation of the science underlying hazards and the consequent interpretation of these findings for the design of human communities.

As well, a number of processes can be modeled using logical networks, as in the scheduling of interdependent tasks, the dating of archaeological artifacts, or the compilation of subroutines comprising a large computer program. Networks provide a common framework for posing and studying problems that often have wider applicability than their originating context.

The goal of this journal is to provide a central forum for the distribution of timely information about network problems, their design and mathematical analysis, as well as efficient algorithms for carrying out optimization on networks. The nonstandard modeling of diverse processes using networks and network concepts is also of interest. Consequently, the disciplines that are useful in studying networks are varied, including applied mathematics, operations research, computer science, discrete mathematics, and economics.

Networks publishes material on the analytic modeling of problems using networks, the mathematical analysis of network problems, the design of computationally ecient network algorithms, and innovative case studies of successful network applications. We do not typically publish works that fall in the realm of pure graph theory (without signicant algorithmic and modeling contributions) or papers that deal with engineering aspects of network design. Since the audience for this journal is then necessarily broad, articles that impact multiple application areas or that creatively use new or existing methodologies are especially appropriate. We seek to publish original, well-written research papers that make a substantive contribution to the knowledge base. In addition, tutorial and survey articles are welcomed.

{"Journal_Name":"NETWORKS & SPATIAL ECONOMICS", "Publisher":"SPRINGER , ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600 , NEW YORK, United States, NY, 10004", "ISSN_eISSN":"1566-113X / 1572-9427", "WoS_Core_Collection":"Science Citation Index Expanded", "Additional_WoS_Indexes":"Current Contents Engineering, Computing & Technology | Essential Science Indicators", "Journal_Website":"https://www.springer.com/journal/11067", "Publication_Frequency":"Quarterly", "Aims_and_Scope":"Networks and Spatial Economics (NETS) is devoted to the mathematical and numerical study of economic activities facilitated by human infrastructure, broadly defined to include technologies pertinent to information, telecommunications, the Internet, transportation, energy storage and transmission, and water resources. Because the spatial organization of infrastructure most generally takes the form of networks, the journal encourages submissions that employ a network perspective. However, non-network continuum models are also recognized as an important tradition that has provided great insight into spatial economic phenomena; consequently, the journal welcomes with equal enthusiasm submissions based on continuum models.

In light of its scope, the intended readership of and contributors to NETS are spatial economists, geographers, regional scientists, applied mathematicians, operations research analysts, infrastructure engineers and other researchers concerned with the spatial organization and operation of infrastructure in both the public and private sectors. Indeed the journal's Editorial Board is drawn from just such a mixture of disciplines.

NETS is committed to high standards of originality and creativity for the papers it publishes. At the same time, NETS is committed to a timely review process. All submissions are to be sent initially to Springer's journal Editorial Office (JEO) from where the Editor-in-Chief will assign them to relevant Area Editors following a preliminary evaluation. A single blind refereeing system whereby the authors do not know the names of the referees assigned to their manuscripts by the Area Editors is employed. In most cases two referee reports will be solicited. Based on these reports, Area Editors make a publication recommendation to the Editor-in-Chief who decides the final disposition of each manuscript.

The journal welcomes the full spectrum of high quality work in networks and spatial economics including theoretical studies, case studies and algorithmic investigations, as well as manuscripts that combine these aspects. Although not devoted exclusively to theoretical studies, the journal is "theory-friendly". That is, well thought out theoretical analyses of important network and spatial economic problems will be considered without bias even if they do not include case studies or numerical examples.

Decision Analysis
Area Editor: James E. Smith
The Decision Analysis area invites papers that improve our understanding of decision making, particularly in problems where uncertainty or conflicting objectives play an important role. Decision analysis researchers often distinguish between normative research that concerns how people should make decisions (e.g., following the subjective expected utility model) and descriptive research that concerns how people or groups actually make decisions and, in particular, how they deviate from the normative ideals. The focus of the decision analysis area is on prescriptive research that concerns how we can help decision makers implement these normative ideals in practice or improve our understanding of optimal decision-making.

Papers may provide methodological contributions or study a specific problem. Papers providing methodological contributions should extend, unify, or improve upon existing methods or describe a novel approach. Decision analysis methods have traditionally included tools for modeling uncertainty (e.g., probability elicitation or Bayesian inference), modeling preferences (e.g., modeling risk preferences or multiattribute utility modeling), and representing and solving decision problems (e.g., using dynamic programming or simulation).

Papers providing problem-oriented contributions should study a decision problem that is of significant interest. The paper may consider a novel application or use novel methods to provide insightful results.

Decision analysis papers may draw on related fields such as the psychology of judgment and choice (e.g., heuristics and biases or prospect theory) or methods for dealing with multiple stakeholders (e.g., game theory or negotiation). However, the focus should be prescriptive, i.e., on improving decision making or improving our understanding of optimal decisions.

In all cases, the contribution must be significant, relevant, and conceptually sound and be of interest to the decision analysis and broader operations research communities.


Environment, Energy, and Sustainability
Area Editors: Erica Plambeck and Daniel Ralph
The Environment, Energy, and Sustainability Area invites papers that apply operations research to sustainable development, energy, natural resource and environmental challenges. These challenges characteristically require insights from multiple disciplines (economics, psychology, statistics, environmental sciences and engineering, etc.) so multi-disciplinary papers are welcome.

Topics of interest include:
Planning and control for natural resource systems including fisheries, forests, and water resources, and in forward and reverse supply chain management;
Novel operations and design problems arising from innovations in sustainable development, transportation, agriculture, cities, green chemistry, and renewable energy;
Planning and control of systems in energy-related industries, such as capacity planning and the operation of large-scale networks for gas and electricity;
Design of markets for electricity, gas, and natural resources; and market-based approaches for environmental issues such as emissions trading;
Design of advanced systems for energy management such as smart grids;
Policy analysis in the above areas that recognizes operational and system design factors that impact policy outcomes and that make concrete policy recommendations.
In a cover letter, submitting authors should briefly describe their papers main contributions. Five sorts of contribution are of particular interest. One is the application of operations research in a real-world setting to substantially improve policy or management, with measurement of the social, environmental and economic implications. The second is a methodological innovation in operations research motivated by important aspects of an environmental, sustainability or energy challenge. (The significance of a methodological contribution depends on the credibility and wide applicability of the underlying models and assumptions; mathematical correctness alone does not warrant publication.) The third is consolidation and insightful appraisal of past work. (A paper should address the relevant literature from other disciplines, not only OR.) The fourth is data gathering. The fifth is novel identification of an important problem or phenomenon that will be of interest to a broad segment of the OR community, through novel modeling and data gathering.
In the cover letter and in ScholarOne, submitting authors should suggest the names of 3 Associate Editors for Operations Research (associated with any area, not only Environment, Energy and Sustainability) and at least 5 referees who would be well qualified to evaluate the paper.

Financial Engineering
Area Editors: Paul Glasserman and Steven Kou
Financial Engineering concerns the development and application of mathematical models and methods for the design and analysis of financial markets, instruments, strategies, and regulations. Fundamental operations research tools of optimization, stochastic modeling, simulation, dynamic programming, and game theory drive much innovation in the financial engineering area and enjoy wide use by finance industry firms, regulatory agencies, and other organizations that employ financial markets to manage capital and risk. Past examples that have generated broad impact include portfolio optimization methods, stochastic models and simulation methods for asset pricing and risk analysis, and dynamic programming methods for trade execution. The evolving nature of financial markets continually gives rise to new challenging problems, while advances in fundamental operations research tools and computer technology continually give rise to new opportunities.

We invite papers that advance the state-of-the-art of models, methods, and their application. We especially encourage submission of papers that address emerging needs such as the measurement and management of systemic risk; the design, use, and regulation of trading venues; and the engineering and analysis of new financial instruments. We also encourage submission of papers that make major methodological advances that are of broad interest to financial engineering researchers and practitioners. Papers should represent original contributions that significantly advance the theory or practice of financial engineering.

Machine Learning and Data Science
Area Editor: Alexandre Belloni and Devavrat Shah
The contemporary availability of data creates a wealth of new opportunities but demands the proper use and development of tools and models to harvest them. Fortunately, the interplay between Operations Research, Machine Learning and Statistics has been increasingly successful in tackling these challenges. The Machine Learning and Data Science Area aims to foster the advance of the theory, understanding and methodologies in the various aspects of data science.

We invite research papers of the highest quality that include original theoretical results on machine learning algorithms, optimization methods that exploit the randomness of the data, and probability theory with implications to data science, as well as more fundamental statistical contributions such as relevant statistical properties of estimators for a desired application. Also of interest are research papers that propose and study methodologies that relate to decision making through data analysis.

In the interest of reproducibility, the area will enforce a policy that any code or data related to a published manuscript should be properly submitted to the journal for archiving.

Revenue Management and Market Analytics
Area Editors: Ilan Lobel and Gustavo Vulcano
The Revenue Management and Market Analytics area considers articles at the forefront of advancing the theory and practice of pricing and revenue management and the design and operation of market platforms.

Rapid changes in information, communication, and computing technology that are altering all aspects of our economic interactions. Not only do these advances enable us to collect ever more detailed data on customer and firm behavior, they also enable much finer grained optimization of all the determinants of market outcomes. As a consequence, market operators or platforms can control a host of variables such as pricing, liquidity, search and matching, information revelation, terms of trade, and transaction fees. Analogously, market participants have far greater control over bidding, pricing, assortment optimization, and revenue optimization.

These forces are being borne out in the rise of online marketplaces across a wide range of industries: more than ever before, we are able to engineer the platforms governing transactions among market participants. These forces are evident in the spectrum of academic research pushing beyond traditional models of pricing and revenue management, including but not limited to: more sophisticated models of consumer choice and behavioral biases; real-time pricing decisions (e.g., as in ride-sharing and ad auctions); fine-grained, dynamic search and matching algorithms; novel rating and review systems; dynamic bundling (and unbundling) of products; personalized assortments and discounts; and rigorous empirical and experimental analyses of market dynamics.

We seek high-impact papers with deep roots in real problems, with a slight preference for significant methodological or analytical contributions including modeling, empirical, and algorithmic advances. We also welcome papers that excel in their modeling and/or computational approach to solve a relevant practical problem, supported by a well-documented numerical study, ideally based on real data.

Military and Homeland Security
Area Editor: Moshe Kress
The Military and Homeland Security (M&HLS) area seeks papers that present original research and innovative models of defense-related problems. Although the area still considers papers that address classical problems such as one-sided and force-on-force modeling, the focus will be on current defense issues such as the value and effect of battlefield information, deployment and operational aspects of unmanned vehicles (such as UAVs), sensor deployment and operation, counterinsurgency operations, and contemporary military logistics problems. Of particular interest are papers that address problems related to the war on terror such as search, detection and mitigation of threats (for example, improvised explosive devices), evaluating the effect of and determining the response to terror attacks, and modeling social aspects in counterinsurgency operations (such as social networks). The area will also consider submissions that model and analyze emergency responses to large-scale disasters such as bio-attacks, earthquakes, and hurricanes.

Two types of papers may be considered for publication:

Original applications of real-world problems, especially if some important and useful operational insights are obtained
New methodological developments and models
Obscure or classified references should be summarized if they are essential, rather than merely referred to, and acronyms should be spelled out on first occurrence. There is bound to be overlap between this area and others. A paper on logistics that focuses on massive transportation by air would be natural for this area, whereas a paper on routine truck routing would more naturally belong in the Transportation area even if the client were military. Authors are encouraged to select the area they deem most natural. Journal editors will send it to a different area if there is good reason. Operations Research was originally a military activity, and Operations Research has been one of the primary journals of record for military OR ever since the first issue in 1952. Our objective is to continue this record of excellence. We encourage military operations research analysts and researchers to submit their excellent work for publication.

Operations and Supply Chains
Area Editors: Tava Olsen and Francis de Vricourt
The Operations and Supply Chains area considers articles at the forefront of advancing the science, management, and engineering of operations, encompassing research on the design, planning, control, and improvement of manufacturing, service, supply, and distribution operations. We encourage papers that examine the interface of operations with other areas, including marketing, finance, accounting, economics, strategy, entrepreneurship/innovation, and behavioral science.

Papers in the Operations and Supply Chain area of Operations Research can either have methodological contribution, practical contribution, or somewhere along the efficient frontier between the two. In general, if an application area is new and interesting then there will be a lower bar for methodological contribution. Whereas, if the application area is old (e.g., standard inventory theory) then there will be a very high bar for methodological contribution. We particularly welcome papers that blend methodologies, for example work that combines mathematical models with behavioral experiments. In all cases, however, the contribution must be significant, relevant, and conceptually sound.

In terms of methodological contribution, we welcome all quantitative methodologies. In particular, we welcome the development of new mathematical models and methods for critical or emerging operational issues, the development of new methods for the empirical analysis of operational phenomena, and/or the incorporation of modern technological advances of business analytics in operations. Papers without any propositions or theorems are unlikely to proceed to review. In terms of practical contribution, we welcome both a management and an engineering view of this.

Optimization
Area Editors: Daniel Kuhn and Sam Burer
Since the early days of OR, optimization has been one of the foundations of this discipline. Over the years, optimization theory and methods have grown in their ability to model and solve a wide variety of problems. Operations Research is committed to this continuing growth and will publish significant contributions in the development of new optimization models and methodologies.

We invite high-quality papers that advance the theory and application of concepts and methodologies in all aspects of optimization. This includes the standard topics of combinatorial, linear, nonlinear, integer and stochastic optimization that involve the development of new conceptual models or new substantial theoretical or computational methodologies arising from applications. The Optimization area will also consider papers that bridge multiple areas within Operations Research, provided that the main contribution of the paper is to substantially new conceptual models, theory or algorithms in optimization.

Papers submitted to the Optimization area should be written in clear and idiomatic English and must accessible and of interest to a large part of the Operations Research Community. Brevity is encouraged, with a suggested maximum length of 30 pages (excluding references and appendices). Longer papers will be considered only in exceptional cases.

OR Practice
Area Editor: Andres Weintraub
Operations research, the field, must keep one foot on real problems as a matter of relevance. Thus, it is important for the journal to carry high-quality articles with applied focus. In that respect, we wish to attract papers that emphasize the complexity and sophistication of applications.

The OR Practice area publishes papers that report on outstanding applications of OR to real problems. The intent of the area is to attract and highlight innovative examples of applied OR that are of interest to the readership of the journal.

OR Practice is also interested in publishing papers that report, based on experience on best OR Practices, surveys of applications in a given area or novel insights into OR applications.

The criteria for publication include the following:

The paper needs to present an actual implementation of a proposed OR solution approach to a firm or organization, with demonstrated and verifiable evidence of impact in decision making or policies due to the implementation.
Novelty of the operations research: Is there an innovation in terms of the OR models or OR methods that are used in the application? Is this a creative use of existing methods or models?
Novelty of the application: Is this a new problem domain for an application of OR?
Impact: Are there quantifiable benefits from the application? What is the impact of the OR on decision-making or on policy? Is there convincing evidence of the improvements from the application of the OR?
Rigor: Is the work rigorous in terms of literature review, formulation, methodology, discussion and impact? Papers should also include information regarding the resources/time involved. An account of the situation prior and following the application and its impact is highly encouraged.
Lessons: Are there any general lessons from the application that would be of value to the readership of the journal? Does the application provide new insights for the practice of OR in a specific context? Does the application demonstrate in some way the value or importance of prior research? Does the application provide a validation for an OR model or framework?
Clarity: Is the paper clearly written? Would the readership of the journal be able to understand and appreciate the contributions from the paper? Can the paper be used as an example of OR with a broader audience, such as students or managers?
Verification: Is the use of the application and resulting benefits verifiable? A verification letter from the relevant organization will normally be included.
Important note. Papers that present developments that do not show a real impact in practice, as for example a prototype case, cannot be considered for OR Practice.

Authors with questions about the appropriateness of their work, even if the paper is not yet written, should contact the Area Editor to discuss the suitability of sending a paper to this area.

Policy Modeling and Public Sector OR
Area Editor: Ozlem Ergun
Decision problems with societal impact most often include complex situations with multiple stakeholders with different and potentially conflicting objectives that dynamically evolve over time with high degrees of uncertainty. The Policy Modeling and Public Sector OR area seeks papers that define important problems and use innovative mathematical models and analytics to solve them for improving outcomes. Especially welcome are manuscripts that utilize data to develop original models linking the design and operations of public programs and systems to recognizable policy outcomes and recommendations. For example, papers examining system design in healthcare and medicine, infrastructure and community resilience, design and management of public services (such as education, transportation, water and sanitation, emergency response, and public safety), humanitarian response, disaster management (mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery), public health, management of scarce resources (such as food, water, and energy), and criminal justice. Although special attention is called to work with recognizable societal implications, "off-the-shelf" applications of standard operations research and statistical techniques are not encouraged. Priority will be given to papers that present novel and convincing data-driven model-based analyses of issues likely to generate widespread public interest, awareness, and impact.

Simulation
Area Editor: L. Jeff Hong
The Simulation area supports the field's continuing growth by publishing significant work in simulation modeling, methodology, and applications that advance the knowledge and practice of simulation.

The maturity of the simulation area suggests that the key growth areas are in its interfaces with other methodological and application areas. Accordingly, in addition to the traditional areas of input modeling, output analysis, variance reduction, verification and validation, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, ranking and selection, simulation optimization, and so on, we welcome contributions that develop the interface of simulation with other methodological areas (for example, large-scaling computing, machine learning and data analytics) or application areas (such as healthcare, financial engineering, sharing economy, environment and energy).

When preparing a paper for the simulation area, authors are encouraged to clearly describe, for a general OR audience, the contributions of the paper. Methodology papers should have broad applicability and explain both the need for and the use of the new methodology. Papers that deal with a significant application area must be more than just well-executed simulation studies of a particular problem. They should emphasize modeling concepts or policy implications that can be adapted to many problems within the application domain and/or more widely, and/or or demonstrate how general problem structures can enable novel techniques of simulation analysis or implementation to improve the size, complexity, or speed of the analysis. Empirical work should be sufficiently well-described that the results can be repeated up to sampling error, perhaps with the aid of an online companion for complicated models.

Stochastic Models
Area Editors: Ramandeep Randhawa and Neil Walton
The Stochastic Models area publishes papers that make significant contributions to the representation and analysis of systems that are intrinsically random.

We welcome papers that propose new models; that develop new methodologies for existing models; that provide new performance insights; or, that improve operational and managerial decision making.

Stochastic modeling is applied in all areas of operations research. Thus, we encourage articles from a broad range of application areas. These include, but are not limited to, service operations, revenue management, manufacturing, supply chain, financial engineering, healthcare, social networks, communication systems, and transportation. Papers on emerging areas are also invited.

Where possible, we encourage papers to have a strong methodological contribution. Example research themes include queueing theory, stochastic optimization, stochastic process limits, Markov decision processes & reinforcement learning, random graphs, statistics learning theory, game theory, and simulation & uncertainty quantification. We encourage authors of papers with a strong technical contribution to highlight the key insights of their work so as to introduce their contributions in a manner that is accessible to a broad operation research readership.

Furthermore, we encourage practical articles where the novel research analysis leads to a strong impact on practice either through direct operational decision making, or by developing tools through stochastic modeling.

In making publication decisions, the editorial board will consider the importance of the systems being modeled, the originality of the modeling and analysis, the quality of the results, the clarity of the exposition, and thus, the overall utility of the work to the OR/MS community.

Transportation
Area Editor: Anton J. Kleywegt
Transportation was one of the earliest application areas of operations research, and important transportation problems, such as the traveling salesman problem, vehicle routing problem, and traffic assignment problem, contributed to fundamental knowledge in operations research. Transportation remains one of the most important and vibrant areas of operations research.

We welcome papers that address any aspect of transportation, including topics that have not traditionally appeared in this journal. It is a requirement that the paper be relevant to operations research. This means that the problem addressed in the paper should be stated precisely, and some form of analysis or numerical method or experimental work be used to obtain significant results. Next I elaborate on the previous statement. Problems that are of interest to a larger part of the operations research community are preferred over problems that are of interest to only a small interest group. Problems involving the physics of transportation as well as problems involving the management of transportation are of interest. Transportation is primarily an application area of operations research, and therefore great emphasis will be placed on good modeling and relevance to real transportation problems. The analysis may involve any appropriate methodology that can be described as precise, including techniques from statistics, optimization, game theory, probability, dynamical systems, or numerical methods. Problems and approaches that are innovative and new to the community are especially welcome. Numerical work and experimental work should be described sufficiently precisely to enable replication of the work. Appendices that facilitate replication of the work, including code and data sets, are welcome. Significant results may include results that facilitate further study, or results that facilitate the solution of important practical problems.

Papers should clearly explain the contribution of the paper in the introduction. The statement of contribution should explain what was added to the knowledge base of operations research and transportation, and not just what work was done for the paper. The paper should state exactly what is new, and if relevant, the contribution of the paper should be compared with the existing literature. The explanation of the contribution should be sufficiently precise to enable an unambiguous verification whether the claim of contribution is correct.

Many research directions in photoacoustics, especially biomedical optoacoustic imaging experience explosive growth in the 21st century. The wealth of investigated topics indicates that this field has developed a broad range of tools for fundamental and applied research. The enormous recent progress is greatly supported by the advances in laser technologies, ultrasound detection approaches, development of inverse theory, and fast reconstruction algorithms. This progress is also driven by a large number of unmet biological and medical needs that can be addressed by the unique contrast of molecular absorption available to photoacoustic - optoacoustic - thermoacoustic methods. These include pre-clinical research and clinical imaging of vasculature, tissue and disease physiology, drug efficacy, surgery guidance, and therapy monitoring. Correspondingly applications span the entire range of medical imaging and sensing applications including cancer, vascular diseases, brain neurophysiology, ophthalmology, and diabetes. Recent technological advances enabled cell trafficking applications and measurements of a multitude of other biological functions. The multidisciplinary nature of photoacoustics - optoacoustics - thermoacoustics is also evidenced by the growing contribution from chemistry and nanotechnology where a variety of novel biodegradable materials from nanoparticles to organic dyes, to targeted agents, theranostic probes and genetically expressed markers are being actively developed. Significant enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio and tissue contrast in photoacoustic methods has been achieved employing these advanced materials.
While some of the spectroscopic and sensing applications in non-biomedical materials have reached a mature state, Photoacoustics supports the research community that develops novel industrial and environmental applications, nondestructive evaluation of materials and new ultrawideband transducers (piezoelectric, capacitive and optical) for sensitive detection of photoacoustic - optoacoustic - thermoacoustic signals.

The list of topics of interest includes (but is not limited to) the following:

Tomography and deep-tissue imaging
Mesoscopy, microscopy, and nanoscopy
Functional and molecular imaging and sensing
Contrast agents, molecular probes, and nanoparticles
Interactions with cells and tissues

This constitutes the physics of motion, covering interactions of all material points from scale of minutiae such as small particles to the very large bodies. The emphasis in the Journal is put upon the analysis of mechanical multi-body systems, but not exclusively. In the case of mechanical systems, all forms of vehicles, machines and mechanisms constitute an assembly of parts that affect the dynamic behaviour of the system as a whole. The multi-physics nature of dynamic analysis often includes interactions of various phenomena, such as large rigid body motions, flexible body oscillations, friction induced stick-slip perturbations, fluid-structure interactions and lubricated contact dynamics. These interactions are described by various force laws, some well understood, but others particularly in the very small physical scale are subject to ongoing research. All contributions, applied or at the frontiers of science of interacting matter are welcome.

The contributions to the Journal should reflect a fundamental approach to the analysis of dynamic systems. Those related to practical engineering multi-body dynamic problems should have a holistic system dynamics approach. Those on design, analysis and experimentation should highlight the interactions between various system components. New techniques of analysis are welcome, as well as practical applications of problem solving methods to industrial systems and products.

There have been a wide variety of published papers in the Journal, dealing with dynamics from nano- and micro-scales to those extending to astronomical distances, from Newtonian mechanics to special and general relativity. Within this broad spectrum there has been a large volume of work in the application of dynamics analysis to mechanical multi-body systems.

Typical topics covered include:

Fundamentals of dynamics analysis, from Newtonian mechanics to Lagrangian dynamics and onto relativistic mechanics, as well as many-body systems
Kinetic interactions from Newtonian perspective to the minutiae; in micro and nano-scales

Papers that deal with new developments in safety or environmental aspects, demonstrating how research results can be used in process engineering design and practice, are particularly encouraged. Experimental or theoretical research work bringing new perspectives to established principles, highlighting unsolved problems or indicating directions for future research will also be considered. The journal is especially interested in contributions that extend the boundaries of traditional engineering as well as in multidisciplinary papers.

Papers related to environmental protection must take an integrated pollution control approach, demonstrating clearly that any proposed treatment method does not simply transfer pollution from one environmental medium to another, for example, from air to water or from water to solid waste. All such papers must discuss how any treatment effluents, spent adsorbents, etc., can be treated or disposed of safely, avoiding transfer of pollution to another environmental medium.

For environmental protection, papers that are outside the scope are those that lack engineering aspects, including those that:

use experimental techniques primarily to prepare and/or characterise various materials without considerations of process engineering design and practice;
present primarily laboratory experiments of the effects of different parameters on behaviour of materials and pollutants (e.g. pH, temperature, mass of adsorbent, etc.) without further insights into the implications for engineering design and practice;
focus primarily on adsorption models and curve fitting (e.g. Freundlich, Langmuir etc.); and
contain only chemical, physical and/or thermodynamic analyses.

Examples of papers that will not be considered for publication are those that report development in materials without relation to data on cell performance, routine analysis, characterisation or modelling of cells or processing sequences, routine reports of system performance, improvements in electronic hardware design, or country programs, although invited papers may occasionally be solicited in these areas to capture accumulated progress.

Systems papers will only be considered in exceptional cases, such as where new developments in system applications have produced substantial progress in energy yield or reliability.

SCP is divided into two tracks. These are: (1) Research papers and (2) Software.

Research Papers Track
These cover four lines of work: (1) Concepts and methodology, (2) Formal techniques, (3) Experimental software technology, (4) Descriptive software technology.

Concepts and methodology is open for methodological, philosophical and sociological studies on all aspects of computer software production and usage, including ethics. Also short papers are allowed here, called viewpoints.
Formal techniques emphasizes the development and the pragmatic application of formal and semi-formal techniques. Submissions that the editors consider mainly mathematical or theoretical in nature, with the preliminary consent of the authors, will formally be forwarded to the sister journal TCS.
Experimental software technology is open for expositions on implementations of and experiments with novel programming languages, systems and methods.
Descriptive software technology deals with observational studies of current software development practices, reporting on new languages, systems and methods, including survey reports on the various themes.
Software Track
SCP disseminates impactful and re-usable scientific software through Original Software Publications. The software track is open for papers describing new software tools of relevance to SCP under the strict condition that the source code of the tools is open. Moreover, the results should be reproducible and show general applicability. By means of the article type of Original Software Publications, versioned software product, corpora and datasets can enter the review process and get published. A copy of the 'accepted for publication' version of software will be copied to the journal's GitHub repository for indexing purposes. Go to the Science of Computer Programming GitHub repository.

Badged for Reproducibility: Software submitted to SCP for consideration is considered for certification for computational reproducibility by the CodeOcean, a cloud based computational reproducibility platform that helps the community by enabling sharing of code and data as a resource for non-commercial use. Certified papers will be given additional exposure by having an attached Reproducibility Badge, and by being listed on the CodeOcean website.

         Survey paper  which would typically provide a brief introduction to a topic appropriate for the journal and follow that introduction with a critical analysis of work to date on the topic; alternatively, a survey paper can take the form of a timely tutorial on techniques not previously documented in the computing literature.



         Experience report  which might take the form of a (1) case study, or (2) a detailed account of a completed software-system project, or (3) a report on practical experience with tools and methods for development and/or evaluation of software and software systems in both academic and industrial environments.



         Short communication  which can introduce a rapidly developing new topic and provide early results on that topic; it will be given higher priority for publication than a regular article.



Articles range in length from a Short Communication (up to ten pages) to the length required to give full treatment to a substantial piece of software (exceptionally up to 40 pages).

Optimization is at the heart of many natural processes including Darwinian evolution, social group behavior and foraging strategies. Over the last few decades, there has been remarkable growth in the field of nature-inspired search and optimization algorithms. Currently these techniques are applied to a variety of problems, ranging from scientific research to industry and commerce. The two main families of algorithms that primarily constitute this field today are the evolutionary computing methods and the swarm intelligence algorithms. Although both families of algorithms are generally dedicated towards solving search and optimization problems, they are certainly not equivalent, and each has its own distinguishing features. Reinforcing each other's performance makes powerful hybrid algorithms capable of solving many intractable search and optimization problems.

The field of swarm intelligence deals with systems composed of many individuals that coordinate using decentralized control and self-organization. In particular, it focuses on the collective behaviors that result from the local interactions of the individuals with each other and with their environment. It is a fast-growing field that encompasses the efforts of researchers in multiple disciplines, ranging from ethology and social science to operations research and computer engineering.
Swarm Intelligence will report on advances in the understanding and utilization of swarm intelligence systems, that is, systems that are based on the principles of swarm intelligence. The following subjects are of particular interest to the journal:
 modeling and analysis of collective biological systems such as social insect colonies, flocking vertebrates, and human crowds as well as any other swarm intelligence systems;
 application of biological swarm intelligence models to real-world problems such as distributed computing, data clustering, graph partitioning, optimization and decision making;
 theoretical and empirical research in ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, swarm robotics, and other swarm intelligence algorithms.

Theoretical and Applied Fracture Mechanics' aims & scopes have been re-designed to cover both the theoretical, applied, and numerical aspects associated with those cracking related phenomena taking place, at a micro-, meso-, and macroscopic level, in materials/components/structures of any kind.

The journal aims to cover the cracking/mechanical behaviour of materials/components/structures in those situations involving both time-independent and time-dependent system of external forces/moments (such as, for instance, quasi-static, impulsive, impact, blasting, creep, contact, and fatigue loading). Since, under the above circumstances, the mechanical behaviour of cracked materials/components/structures is also affected by the environmental conditions, the journal would consider also those theoretical/experimental research works investigating the effect of external variables such as, for instance, the effect of corrosive environments as well as of high/low-temperature. The journal will also consider technical articles assessing the cracking behaviour of new materials used in modern and alternative applications, i.e., not only strictly related to engineering. Further, the most advanced technological findings in the surface engineering field are seen to strongly influence the cracking/mechanical behaviour of materials. Accordingly, technical articles investigating, both from a theoretical and an experimental point of view, the existing interactions between the above aspects and the material cracking behaviour will be considered for publication.

The modelling of the phenomena of interest for the Journal can be based on the conventional linear-elastic/elasto-plastic Fracture Mechanics concepts as well as on novel (or emerging) theories. The journal is keen to publish new/alternative modelling/design approaches, provided that such innovative theories are soundly based on the state-of-the-art knowledge and, when possible, validated through appropriate experimental results.In more general terms, cracks act as stress/strain concentrators. Accordingly, the Journal is very keen to consider for publication also those studies investigating the effect on the mechanical behaviour of materials/components/structures of different kinds of stress/strain concentrators such as defects, microstructural in-homogeneities, and, above all, notches of any kind. In more detail, one of the new features of Theoretical and Applied Fracture Mechanics is releasing regular issues addressing, in a systematic way, the notch mechanics problem. In this setting, as for those studies involving cracks, such special issues will consider not only conventional, but also innovative materials subjected to both time-independent and time-dependent loading.

The increasing computational power of modern computers is strongly encouraging the scientific community to develop novel methodologies suitable for modelling the mechanical behaviour of materials/components/structures containing any kind of stress/strain concentrators (i.e., not only cracks and notches, but also defects and microstructural in-homogeneities). Accordingly, Theoretical and Applied Fracture Mechanics aims to publish, through regular issues fully focussed on computational mechanics, also those technical articles addressing the theoretical/computational aspects leading to an efficient and accurate modelling of the behaviour, at a micro-, meso-, and macroscopic level, of materials and structures containing stress/strain raisers of any kind.

In light of the new aims and scopes characterising Theoretical and Applied Fracture Mechanics, the journal will be organised according to the following topical issues:

Miscellany of technical articles fully meeting the aims and scopes of the journal;
Technical articles investigating the notch mechanics field;
Technical articles devoted to the computational mechanics aspects;
Themed threads, guest-edited by experts, where the themes of interest could not necessarily be addressed in a single issue: this would create a string of issues showing, over years, the progresses made in a specific area of the Fracture/Notch/Computational Mechanics discipline.
The themed threads will be guest-edited not only by the Members of the Editorial Board, but also, as mentioned above, by leading experts. In this setting, the Editorial Boards is interested in considering possible topics directly suggested by leading experts also willing to act as guest-editors. Finally, the Journal will consider the publication of special issues containing the extended version of high-level papers presented at prominent international conferences.

The Scope of this Journal
 
Theoretical and Computational Fluid Dynamics provides a forum for the cross fertilization of ideas across all disciplines in which fluid flow plays a role. The focus is on aspects of fluid dynamics where theory and computation are used to provide insights and data upon which solid physical understanding is revealed and/or models are proposed.
 
The following areas are outside the scope of the journal. Papers addressing them will not be accepted and will be returned to the authors without review:
 
1. Papers focusing on numerical methods, algorithmic improvements, and code validation, unless the methodology is closely associated with novel physical insights.
2. Papers focused on cataloging analytical or numerical flow solutions without contextualization in terms of real flows in technology or nature.
3. Papers focused on industrial devices and/or engineering prediction, unless there is also a significant emphasis on novel observations about related flow phenomena.
4. Papers focused on engineering prediction, unless there is also a significant emphasis on novel observations about related flow phenomena.
5. Papers employing analytical and/or numerical techniques for the solution of simplified (e.g. steady, 1-D,...) flow limits, devoid of bifurcation analysis of the resulting model flow.
6. Papers focusing primarily on numerical methods, algorithmic improvements, code validation, and/or tuning of models.
7. Papers focused on cataloging analytical or numerical flow solutions, unless there are close connections with observations and measurements in technological or natural flow.
8. Papers in which poor English grammar and usage interfere with the scientific meaning.

When submitting with the journal you will be asked to acknowledge this prerequisite of submission.

Its aim is to understand the nature of computation and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies. All papers introducing or studying mathematical, logic and formal concepts and methods are welcome, provided that their motivation is clearly drawn from the field of computing.

Any queries about submissions and peer review should be addressed to the TCS editorial office: tcs@elsevier.com.

Papers published in Theoretical Computer Science are grouped in three sections according to their nature. The first section `Algorithms, automata, complexity and games' is devoted to the study of algorithms and their complexity using analytical, combinatorial or probabilistic methods. It includes the whole field of abstract complexity (i.e. all the results about the hierarchies that can be defined using Turing machines), the whole field of automata and language theory (including automata on infinite words and infinitary languages), the whole field of geometrical (graphic) applications and the whole field of measurement of system performance using statistical methods.

The second section,`Logic, semantics and theory of programming', is devoted to formal methods to check properties of programs or implement formally described languages; it contains all papers dealing with semantics of sequential and parallel programming languages. All formal methods treating these problems are published in this section, including rewriting techniques, abstract data types, automatic theorem proving, calculi such as SCP or CCS, Petri nets, new logic calculi and developments in categorical methods.

The third section, 'Natural Computing', is devoted to the study of computing occurring in nature and computing inspired by nature. In the rapidly evolving field of computer science, natural computing plays an important role as the catalyst for the synergy of human designed computing with the computing going on in nature. This synergy leads to a deeper and broader understanding of the nature of computation. Although natural computing is concerned also with experiments and applications, this section of Theoretical Computer Science is focused on the theoretical aspects of natural computing with clear relevance to computing. Among others, it will contain papers dealing with the theoretical issues in evolutionary computing, neural networks, molecular computing, and quantum computing.

Theoretical Computer Science will now publish high-quality advanced introductions. Advanced introductions, which are by invitation only, should cover a focused topic within the scope of TCS at a level that would be appropriate for a scientist who is new to the topic and wishes to gain an up-to-date understanding. Articles should be self-contained, including motivation and basic definitions, and proceed to advanced material and/or open problems which may - but need not - include new results. Sufficient references should be given to provide the reader with entry points to the research literature on the topic as well as the origins of the main ideas.

It is intended that these will be of current relevance and interest to industry, academia and other practitioners.

It is evident that many specialised journals in thermal and, to some extent, in fluid disciplines tend to focus on topics that can be classified as fundamental in nature, or are `applied? and near-market.

The range of topics covered by Thermal Science and Engineering Progress addresses the rapid rate of development being made in thermal transfer processes as they affect traditional fields, and important growth in the topical research areas of aerospace, thermal biological and medical systems, electronics and nano-technologies, renewable energy systems, food production (including agriculture), and the need to minimise man-made thermal impacts on climate change.

Papers on porous media research may originate in various areas of physics, chemistry, biology, natural or materials science, and engineering (chemical, civil, agricultural, petroleum, environmental, electrical, and mechanical engineering)
Emphasizes theory, (numerical) modelling, laboratory work, and non-routine applications
Publishes work of a fundamental nature, of interest to a wide readership, that provides novel insight into porous media processes
Expanded in 2007 from 12 to 15 issues per year
Transport in Porous Media publishes original research on physical and chemical aspects of transport phenomena in rigid and deformable porous media. These phenomena, occurring in single and multiphase flow in porous domains, can be governed by extensive quantities such as mass of a fluid phase, mass of component of a phase, momentum, or energy. Moreover, porous medium deformations can be induced by the transport phenomena, by chemical and electro-chemical activities such as swelling, or by external loading through forces and displacements. These porous media phenomena may be studied by researchers from various areas of physics, chemistry, biology, natural or materials science, and engineering (chemical, civil, agricultural, petroleum, environmental, electrical, and mechanical engineering).

Transport and deformation phenomena, understood from the microscopic scale upward, form the basis for deterministic and stochastic models that describe them. The models are adaptable to describe (coupled) transport phenomena and deformation in any kind of natural or engineered porous material, including: flow and contaminant transport in aquifers; oil and gas movement in petroleum reservoirs; solvent drives and enhanced oil recovery; heat and mass transport in packed bed reactors, in geothermal reservoirs, and in building materials; spread of pollutants from radioactive waste repositories; drying in porous materials; flow and transport in fuel cells, paper, and absorbing materials; filtration processes; biomedical studies of fluid and chemical transport in lungs and other organs.

Our interest is not only with transportation policies - and systems and services  but also with their social, economic and environmental impacts, However, papers about the application of established procedures to, or the development of plans or policies for, specific locations are unlikely to prove acceptable unless they report experience which will be of real benefit those working elsewhere. Papers concerned with the engineering, safety and operational management of transportation systems are outside our scope.

Papers submitted for publication in Transportation should not have been published, accepted for publication, nor submitted for review elsewhere (whether previously or concurrently), in their present or any essentially similar form. If a paper has been submitted for publication elsewhere, the authors must provide details of that previous submission. Further, authors need to make clear the distinctive contribution of their paper relative to both their own previous work and that of others.

Papers published in Transportation are initially assessed for length and relevance. Papers considered suitable for review are then subjected to peer review in accordance with standard international practice for scholarly journals. They are only accepted for publication once the authors have responded adequately to advice given by the referees. Publication of a paper in Transportation therefore accords with the requirements of academic appointment and promotion panels.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"ABS Academic Journal Quality Guide, ANVUR, Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC) Journal Quality List, BFI List, Baidu, CAB Abstracts, CLOCKSS, CNKI, CNPIEC, Current Contents / Social & Behavioral Sciences, Current Contents/Engineering, Computing and Technology, Dimensions, EBSCO Applied Science & Technology Source, EBSCO Computers & Applied Sciences Complete, EBSCO Discovery Service, EBSCO Engineering Source, EBSCO OmniFile, EBSCO STM Source, EBSCO Science Full Text Select, EI Compendex, EconLit, Engineering Village  GEOBASE, Google Scholar, Japanese Science and Technology Agency (JST), Journal Citation Reports/Science Edition, Journal Citation Reports/Social Sciences Edition, Naver, OCLC WorldCat Discovery Service, Portico, ProQuest ABI/INFORM, ProQuest International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS), ProQuest-ExLibris Primo, ProQuest-ExLibris Summon, Research Papers in Economics (RePEc), SCImago, SCOPUS, Science Citation Index, Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), Social Science Citation Index, TD Net Discovery Service, Transport Research International Documentation(TRID), UGC-CARE List (India), WTI AG, Wanfang"}

The emphasis of the journal is on empirical findings and policy responses of a regulatory, planning, technical or fiscal nature. Articles are primarily policy-driven and should be relevant and applied as well as being accessible to readers from a wide range of disciplines. There are no disciplinary boundaries to work considered and submissions of an interdisciplinary nature are welcomed. Equally, the journal is fully international in its orientation and invites contributions from economically developing, as well as more economically advanced, countries. Submissions should not be primarily modeling exercises but have a clear policy-driven scope that delves into impacts and solutions to improve environmental outcomes.

We are pleased to announce the formation of a new section of Transportation Research D focusing on Disasters and Resilience. This section will be edited by Karl Kim (University of Hawaii), John Renne (Florida Atlantic University) and Brian Wolshon (Louisiana State University). Transportation plays a critical role in the resilience of communities. Disasters are unexpected, low probability events which can overwhelm the capacity of systems to function and provide vital services supporting human health, environmental quality, and economic and social livelihoods. Transportation systems are essential to effective disaster response, relief, recovery, and mitigation. Emergency responders must be able to travel quickly to disaster scenes. Households, firms, and transport agencies need to develop and implement evacuation and sheltering plans involving the management of different modes, vehicles, roadways, and systems to ensure safety and security. Transportation systems need to be integrated into risk and vulnerability assessments, recovery and reconstruction projects, and longer term efforts to plan, design, and engineer resilient facilities and communities. Transportation systems serve as the connective tissue which links both internal and external resources associated with disaster response and recovery.

This section of Transportation Research D will build on the special capabilities and interests of transportation researchers, coming from multiple disciplines, worldwide, to address the critical ways in which transportation science and the supporting theories, methods, and tools can be applied to increase societal resilience against all hazards, both natural and man-made. In addition to the wide range of natural hazards including both geo-physical and hydro-meteorological, the section will also cover industrial accidents, cascading events (where one hazard such as an earthquake can trigger a release of toxins and harmful substances into the environment), and intentional acts of sabotage or terrorism. In each of these disasters and emergencies, transportation plays a significant role. Core concepts such as travel demand modeling, rare event forecasting, activity based analyses, system performance monitoring, optimization across time and space, mode choice, network analysis, geospatial modeling, and many other methods are appropriate topics for this section.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"Review of Research on Freight Transport and Logistics, Journal of Economic Literature, Journal of Economic Literature, Science Citation Index Expanded, FMS Journal Rating Guide, International Civil Engineering Abstracts, Applied Science & Technology Abstracts, Applied Science and Technology Index, International Abstracts in Operations Research, ANVUR - Agenzia Nazionale di Valutazione del Sistema Universitario e della Ricerca, Social Sciences Citation Index, Research Alert, Social Scisearch, Current Contents - Social & Behavioral Sciences, INSPEC, Scopus, TRID, the TRIS and ITRD Database"}

As the foremost scientific journal in the cross-disciplinary operational research field of transportation analysis, Transportation Science publishes high-quality original contributions and surveys on phenomena associated with all modes of transportation, present and prospective, including all levels of planning, design, economic, operational, and social aspects. Transportation Science focuses primarily on fundamental theories, coupled with observational and experimental studies of transportation and logistics phenomena and processes, mathematical models, advanced methodologies and novel applications in transportation and logistics systems analysis, planning and design. The journal covers a broad range of topics, including vehicular and human traffic flow theories, models and their application to traffic operations and management, strategic, tactical, and operational planning of transportation and logistics systems; performance analysis methods and system design and optimization, theories and analysis methods for network and spatial activity interaction, equilibrium and dynamics; economics of transportation system supply and evaluation, methodologies for analysis of transportation user behavior and the demand for transportation and logistics services.  Transportation Science is international in scope, with editors from nations around the globe. The journal areas reflect the diverse interdisciplinary interests of the transportation science and logistics community, with members that hold primary affiliations in engineering (civil, industrial, and aeronautical), physics, economics, applied mathematics, and business.

Having recently celebrated its 50th Anniversary, Transportation Science is in a period of significant growth. In January 2021, the journal introduced a new editorial structure to accommodate this growth and maintain the rigor and quality that is the hallmark of the journal and its review process. As with many INFORMS journals, Transportation Science is now divided by topical areas, each led by an Area Editor. Because the field of transportation science is inherently cross-disciplinary, there are natural overlaps between areas; for example, in common themes, problem characteristics, and methodologies. When submitting papers to the journal, authors are asked to designate an area for review; however, these overlaps may result in multiple options for a submission. Authors may suggest more than one area and the Editor-in-Chief, in consultation with Area Editors, will determine the appropriate area.

 

Areas Statements

 

Logistics & routing

Logistics and routing problems are a cornerstone of transportation science and have drawn the attention of researchers for many decades. In turn, research in this area has contributed to the development of both the theory and practice of operations research and management science beyond transportation and logistics. The rapid pace of supply chain and transportation innovation offer significant opportunities for new advances and continued far reaching impact for routing and logistics research. The logistics and routing area seeks to be the home for this research. The logistics and routing area features papers that advance models and solution methods for classical and novel problems arising in vehicle routing, business logistics, and humanitarian logistics. Papers that study innovative applications in ways that advance the science of logistics and routing are also encouraged. Papers should present exciting new modeling and methodological approaches to logistics and routing and bring new scientific knowledge to issues that impact the delivery of goods and services. Papers can cover broad topics in supply chain and logistics from the strategic to the operational level across all industries. The area particularly encourages contributions that integrate data-driven optimization or real-time decision-making into new and existing logistics and routing problems.

 

Modes & industries

Researchers in the field of transportation science have introduced models and methods that have significantly improved strategic, tactical and operational decisions across the many modes and industries related to transportation globally.  The modes and industries area focuses on research that is grounded in transportation modes or industries; e.g., aviation, rail, maritime, public transit.  Included in this area is the study of the economics of transportation system supply and evaluation.  While some problems of study in this area are motivated by the characteristics of a specific mode or industry, others focus on features that may be found across multiple modes or industries.  For example, many transportation systems, across different modes, involve interdependent decisions across competing parties that share resources.   We consider papers that propose novel approaches to the design and optimization of mechanisms to guide the use of these shared resources.   Papers may also consider the decisions of a single organization, covering models for service network design, planning, and scheduling.  Mode-specific topics may include safety analysis of aviation systems, econometric or machine learning models for analysis of aviation data, berth assignments in maritime ports.  We also encourage research focused on changes in modes and industries as technology continues to advance transportation and mobility broadly defined.  Such topics include research to re-envision urban air mobility and mobility-as-a-service models.  This area also includes shared transportation systems like bikes or scooters, as well as work exploring the value of drones in delivery systems.

 

Traffic, demand & network analysis

The study of human and vehicular traffic has always been core to transportation science. It aims to deepen the understanding of how travelers make travel choices and how they interact with a transportation facility or network, and how these interactions yield the performance of the facility or network. It further strives to prescribe a more desirable design, control and management of the transportation facility or network. The traffic, demand and network analysis area features papers that span the breadth of this research area, including transportation systems analysis; vehicular and human traffic flow theories, traffic operations and management; network equilibrium and dynamics; and demand modeling and analysis. We seek high-quality, scholarly research that substantially advances the associated methodologies or theories, offers important behavioral, managerial or policy insights, or provides high-impact actionable prescriptions or innovative solutions. We note that human and vehicular traffic is being fundamentally changed by new technology, the availability of real time data and innovations to dynamically adjust systems to adapt to this data at a rapid pace.  We welcome fundamental, methodological studies that explore the implications of new technologies, data sources, and mobility innovations on travel behaviors, traffic flow characteristics and the design, control, operations and management of surface transportation facilities and systems.   

 

Emerging & cross-functional topics

Recognizing that many new and/or cross-functional areas of transportation science may not fit within the other areas, papers in this area represent emerging topics, as well as cross-functional applications and activities within transportation.  Emerging topics are ones that have not yet been the topic of articles in Transportation Science, but are related to the topic of transportation.  Examples of such topics include the use of new delivery technology, new applications that require significant changes from existing models, and the use of new solution methods that can broadly impact knowledge in transportation science, such as novel applications of machine learning to leverage the massive explosion of data related to mobility.  Further examples of emerging topics include papers on humanitarian and nonprofit logistics that address new disaster types, objectives, or other major differences in features from previous work.    Cross-functional topics by definition are quite broad and varied but challenge us to consider new perspectives on existing problems, new problems or solution methods involving features from multiple disciplines, and examining the impact of various transportation policies on stakeholders.  Examples of new perspectives include modeling equity in access to transportation or developing improvements to the sustainability of transportation systems.   Papers may explore econometric and simulation models for transportation policy decisions or policy and economic analysis of environmental incentives and regulations related to transportation activities.  The review of papers in this area will heavily weigh the innovation, novelty, and societal importance of the work presented.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"Additional indexing and abstract services for INFORMS journals:, American Psychological Association,, Cision,, Emerald,, In-Store Marketing Institute,, RePEc,, SciVerse Scopus,, WorldCat.org (OCLC),, Zentralblatt MATH Database"}

In relation to data mining, the journal will handle submissions where systems issues play a significant role. Factors that we use to determine whether a data mining paper is within scope include:

The submission targets systems issues in relation to data mining, e.g., by covering integration with a database engine or with other data management functionality.
The submissions contributions build on (rather than simply cite) work already published in database outlets, e.g., VLDBJ, ACM TODS, PVLDB, ACM SIGMOD, IEEE ICDE, EDBT.

The journal addresses various types of solid wastes including municipal (e.g., residential, institutional, and commercial), agricultural, and special (e.g., construction and demolition, household hazardous, sewage sludge, and non-hazardous industrial) wastes.

We welcome both fundamental and applied research that can be related to problems of interest to solid waste researchers, practitioners and/or policy makers. Well documented case studies will be considered but they must describe results that can be applied beyond the specific location of the case study. Manuscripts that focus on the use of a waste material in a new product are often more suitable for a journal that focuses on the material properties of the product. In considering whether a manuscript is suitable for publication in Waste Management, consider whether the information is of potential use to solid waste researchers, practitioners and/or policymakers.

The challenge to society is to minimize these impacts, maintain an acceptable quality of the environment, and sustain the quality of life and resource supplies for future generations. The generation of solid wastes is inevitable because all products have an end of life and humans and animals create wastes that have to be managed to maintain hygienic, healthy and tidy urban and open country environments. A key objective of the Waste Management and Research. The Journal for a Sustainable Circular Economy (WM&R) is to address these challenges through dissemination of scientifically based reliable information, e.g. in terms of waste prevention, waste recycling, recovery of energy from material residuals not suited for recycling or reuse, waste treatment, and waste disposal.

WM&R is a peer-reviewed journal that satisfies the growing demand for new and scientific information that can be referenced by waste management professionals in academia, government, industry, planning, engineering, management and operation. WM&R presents original work in the form of review articles, original articles, short articles, and letters to the editor.

WM&R encourages the submission of well organized manuscripts relating to sustainable waste management designs, operations, policies or practices and those addressing issues facing both developing and developed countries. Mass flow analyses, life cycle assessments, policy planning and system administration, innovative processes and technologies and their engineering features and cost effectiveness are among the key issues that WM&R seeks to cover through well documented reports on new concepts, systems, practical experience (including case studies), and theoretical and experimental research work. Manuscripts with limited scope or specialised application are normally not accepted. Studies on testing and characterisation of special waste streams or products with only a peripheral pertinence to solid waste management are normally referred to journals that focus on such topics. Manuscripts about modelling and software development are acceptable, when model and software applications remain accessible in the public domain. It is imperative that manuscripts are well founded in terms of existing literature and knowledge, including both recent and older publications.

Peer reviewers and editors evaluating manuscripts for publication consider as key criteria; originality, novelty and applicability of results in theory and/or in practice. Articles must be clearly written in UK English and authors must avoid duplication of information already published and avoid citing opinions without referenced foundations. Strict compliance with these and other WM&R manuscript submission guidelines is necessary to trigger the peer review process that could lead to subsequent acceptance for publication.", "Indexing_and_Abstracting":"Abi/inform, BIOSIS database, Biological Abstracts Family of Products, CSA Environmental Sciences & Pollution Management, Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), Clarivate Analytics: BIOSIS Previews, Clarivate Analytics: Biological Abstracts, Compendex, Current Contents / Agriculture, Biology, and Environmental Sciences, Current Contents / Engineering, Comp, & Tech, Current Contents, Agric, Bio, Env.

Broadly, topics of interest range from development of fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of wear to innovative solutions to practical engineering problems. Authors of experimental studies are expected to comment on the repeatability of the data, and whenever possible, conduct multiple measurements under similar testing conditions. Further, Wear embraces the highest standards of professional ethics, and the detection of matching content, either in written or graphical form, from other publications by the current authors or by others, may result in rejection.

Submissions are invited on such subjects as:

(a) Wear modelling and validation. This includes modelling of fundamental mechanisms as well as the modelling of tribosystems. Approaches may employ contact mechanics, frictional considerations and lubrication concepts in the development of the model, and will always include physical validation of the model.

(b) The development and use of new wear testing methods and standards. This includes the rationale behind their development (including a critique of existing test methodologies where appropriate).

(c) New wear diagnostic tools. The need for these tools and examples of their use in either basic research or engineering should be illustrated.

(d) The development of wear-resistant materials, coatings, or surface treatments. Such papers should include, for example, benchmarking against materials currently employed in targeted engineering applications, or presenting a basic hypothesis underlying the work that can be validated as an advance over the current state-of-the-art. The criteria used to select the test methods employed (and the conditions under which those tests were conducted) must be robustly justified with regard to the targeted engineering applications. The proposed mechanisms of wear must be discussed in the context of data and observations that support those conclusions.

(e) Relationships between the composition, structure, properties, and processing of materials and their wear behavior. Such submissions should include the basic rationale for the work, its foundation in prior knowledge, and how the current approach is implemented to explore these relationships. The criteria used to select the tests or analytical methods employed shall be explained with respect to the purpose of the research, be it fundamental or applied.

(f) The role of lubricants or other interfacial species in the wear of materials. Such submissions will focus on the mechanisms of wear in the presence of well-characterized interfacial environments.

The Abstracts of all submissions, whether a full paper or a shorter communication, should summarize the purpose and approach to the given problem, indicate the materials under investigation, and present the primary conclusions in a brief and concise manner. Overt commercialism or product promotion is unacceptable. Submissions to Wear will be peer-reviewed to assess their archival quality, clarity of communication, and the novelty of their contributions to the science and technology of wear.

For the very high volume of submissions that we are experiencing at this time and for the problems and disruptions by the ongoing pandemic WEAR is currently not accepting any unsolicited review papers, white papers or perspectives.
